  abstract = {An accurate force calculation with the Poisson\textendash Boltzmann equation is challenging, as it requires the electric field on the molecular surface. Here we present a calculation of the electric field on the solute\textendash solvent interface that is exact for piecewise linear variations of the potential and analyze four different alternatives to compute the force using a boundary element method. We performed a verification exercise for two cases: the isolated and two interacting molecules. Our results suggest that the boundary element method outperforms the finite difference method, as the latter needs a much finer mesh than in solvation energy calculations to get acceptable accuracy in the force, whereas the same surface mesh as in a standard energy calculation is appropriate for the boundary element method. Among the four evaluated alternatives of force calculation, we saw that the most accurate one is based on the Maxwell stress tensor. However, for a realistic application, like the barnase\textendash barstar complex, the approach based on variations of the energy functional, which is less accurate, gives equivalent results. This analysis is useful toward using the Poisson\textendash Boltzmann equation for force calculations in applications where high accuracy is key, for example, to feed molecular dynamics models or to enable the study of the interaction between large molecular structures, like viruses adsorbed onto substrates.},

  abstract = {The gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds is an important chemical process in the Earth's atmosphere. It governs oxidant levels and controls the production of key secondary pollutants, and hence has major implications for air quality and climate. Organic oxidation is largely controlled by the chemistry of a few reactive intermediates, namely, alkyl (R) radicals, alkoxy (RO) radicals, peroxy (RO2) radicals, and carbonyl oxides (R1R2COO), which may undergo a number of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Our understanding of these intermediates, and the reaction pathways available to them, is based largely on studies of unfunctionalized intermediates, formed in the first steps of hydrocarbon oxidation.

In this Perspective, we explore the unique chemistry available to functionalized organic intermediates in the Earth's atmosphere.

We discuss the challenges associated with the study of the chemistry of such intermediates and review novel experimental and theoretical approaches that have recently provided (or hold promise for providing) new insights into their atmospheric chemistry. The continued use and development of such techniques and the close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians are necessary for a complete, detailed understanding of the chemistry of functionalized intermediates and their impact on major atmospheric chemical processes.}

  abstract = {The gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds is an important chemical process in the Earth's atmosphere. It governs oxidant levels and controls the production of key secondary pollutants, and hence has major implications for air quality and climate. Organic oxidation is largely controlled by the chemistry of a few reactive intermediates, namely, alkyl (R) radicals, alkoxy (RO) radicals, peroxy (RO2) radicals, and carbonyl oxides (R1R2COO), which may undergo a number of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Our understanding of these intermediates, and the reaction pathways available to them, is based largely on studies of unfunctionalized intermediates, formed in the first steps of hydrocarbon oxidation. However, it has become increasingly clear that intermediates with functional groups, which are generally formed later in the oxidation process, can exhibit fundamentally different reactivity than unfunctionalized ones. In this Perspective, we explore the unique chemistry available to functionalized organic intermediates in the Earth's atmosphere. After a brief review of the canonical chemistry available to unfunctionalized intermediates, we discuss how the addition of functional groups can introduce new reactions, either by changing the energetics or kinetics of a given reaction or by opening up new chemical pathways.

Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 4913-4928]) has been extended to the employment of explicitly correlated (F12) methods. A thorough benchmark based on a wide range of prototypical reactions shows that the new model (referred to as junChS-F12), which employs cost-effective revDSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ) reference geometries, has an improved performance with respect to its conventional counterpart and outperforms the most well-known model chemistries without the need of any empirical parameter and at an affordable computational cost. Several benchmarks show that revDSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ) structures and force fields provide zero point energies and thermal contributions, which can be confidently used, together with junChS-F12 electronic energies, for obtaining accurate reaction rates in the framework of the master equation approach based on the ab initio transition-state theory.}

  abstract = {Global potentials for the physisorption of rare- gas atoms on graphene and graphite, amenable for a variety of dynamics simulations, are reported. An atom\textbackslash textminusbond pairwise additive form of the potential is used, where the interaction pairs, represented by proper analytical functions, are constituted by the Rg atom (Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr) and the C\textbackslash textminusC bonds of the graphene sheet(s). The parameters of the atom\textbackslash textminusbond pair potential, derived from the polarizability of the interacting partners, are fine-tuned, exploiting calculations of the prototypical Rg\textbackslash textminuscoronene system using high-level electronic structure methods and large basis sets. The atom\textbackslash textminusgraphene/graphite potential is further expanded in a Fourier series, and it is found that for an accurate representation of the interaction only a small number of corrugation terms need to be added to the laterally averaged potential. Furthermore, this corrugation part of the potential is both identical for Rg\textbackslash textminusgraphene and Rg\textbackslash textminus graphite; in other words, inner layers of graphite only play a role in the laterally averaged Rg\textbackslash textminusgraphite potential. For all systems, the hollow at the center of the carbon ring is the preferred adsorption site, although diffusion barriers are low. The present results compare well with previous data regarding well depths and equilibrium distances at different adsorption sites and, for graphite, the long-range dispersion coefficient C3. In addition, binding energies (eigenvalues of the laterally averaged potentials) are in a fairly good agreement with experimental determinations, providing further support for the reliability of the potentials.},

The performance of different functionals is evaluated by extensive benchmark calculations of energy gaps in a variety of diradicals and open-shell atoms. The benchmark set consists of 41 energy gaps. A consistently good performance is observed for the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) family, in particular PBE0 and PBE50, which yield mean average deviations of 0.126 and 0.090 eV, respectively. In most cases, the performance of original (collinear) SF-TDDFT with 50-50 functional is also satisfactory (as compared to non-collinear variants), except for the same-center diradicals where both collinear and non-collinear SF variants that use LYP or B97 exhibit large errors. The accuracy of NC-SF-TDDFT and collinear SF-TDDFT with 50-50 and BHHLYP is very similar. Using PBE50 within collinear formalism does not improve the accuracy.},

  abstract = {The many-body expansion (MBE) is promising for the efficient, parallel computation of lattice energies in organic crystals. Very high accuracy should be achievable by employing coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples at the complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS] for the dimers, trimers, and potentially tetramers resulting from the MBE, but such a brute-force approach seems impractical for crystals of all but the smallest molecules. Here, we investigate hybrid or multi-level approaches that employ CCSD(T)/CBS only for the closest dimers and trimers and utilize much faster methods like M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for more distant dimers and trimers. For trimers, MP2 is supplemented with the Axilrod\textendash Teller\textendash Muto (ATM) model of three-body dispersion. MP2(+ATM) is shown to be a very effective replacement for CCSD(T)/CBS for all but the closest dimers and trimers. A limited investigation of tetramers using CCSD(T)/CBS suggests that the four-body contribution is entirely negligible. The large set of CCSD(T)/CBS dimer and trimer data should be valuable in benchmarking approximate methods for molecular crystals and allows us to see that a literature estimate of the core-valence contribution of the closest dimers to the lattice energy using just MP2 was overbinding by 0.5 kJ mol-1, and an estimate of the three-body contribution from the closest trimers using the T0 approximation in local CCSD(T) was underbinding by 0.7 kJ mol-1. Our CCSD(T)/CBS best estimate of the 0 K lattice energy is -54.01 kJ mol-1, compared to an estimated experimental value of -55.3 {$\pm$} 2.2 kJ mol-1.},

  abstract = {An Ising-type model for spin conversion, explicitly accounting for intramolecular vibrations has been studied. Each two level system is associated with p harmonic oscillators having two possible frequencies w\_LS, w\_HS. The major advantage of this model is that it provides an excellent agreement with both the conversion curve and calorimetric data, in particular the entropy change upon spin conversion. With the help of Arrhenius plots, the predictions of the model are accurately compared to the literature experimental data on the spin equilibrium curves. A very accurate M\"ossbauer investigation by Jacobi, Spiering and G\"utlich, provides evidence for a small effect typical for vibrations. A novel example is given where the conversion curve is essentially monitored by vibrations; this originates from the extremely small value of the energy gap between HS and LS electrovibrational groundstates. However, in most cases, as a first approach, the low freqeuncy approximation of the model can be used. Then the model reduces to a simple two-level model with additional degeneracies implicitely accounting for intramolecular vibrations.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method for the computation of well-defined optimized atomic partial charges and radii from the total electron density. Our method is based on a two-step radical Voronoi tessellation of the (possibly periodic) system and subsequent integration of the total electron density within each Voronoi cell. First, the total electron density is partitioned into the contributions of each molecule, and subsequently the electron density within each molecule is assigned to the individual atoms using a second set of atomic radii for the radical Voronoi tessellation. The radii are optimized on-the-fly to minimize the fluctuation (variance) of molecular and atomic charges. Therefore, our method is completely free of empirical parameters. As a by-product, two sets of optimized atomic radii are produced in each run, which take into account many specific properties of the system investigated. The application of an on-the-fly interpolation scheme reduces discretization noise in the Voronoi integration. The approach is particularly well suited for the calculation of partial charges in periodic bulk phase systems. We apply the method to five exemplary liquid phase simulations and show how the optimized charges can help to understand the interactions in the systems. Well-known effects such as reduced ion charges below unity in ionic liquid systems are correctly predicted without any tuning, empiricism, or rescaling. We show that the basis set dependence of our method is very small. Only the total electron density is evaluated, and thus, the approach can be combined with any electronic structure method that provides volumetric total electron densities\textemdash it is not limited to Hartree\textendash Fock or density functional theory (DFT). We have implemented the method into our open-source software tool TRAVIS.},

Both Mulliken charges and charges fit to the electrostatic potential surface (EPS) were considered in conjunction with OPLS Lennard\textendash Jones parameters for the organic molecules and the TIP4P model of water. Monte Carlo simulations with statistical perturbation theory yielded relative free energies of hydration. These were converted to absolute quantities through perturbations to reference molecules for which absolute free energies of hydration had been obtained previously in TIP4P water. The average errors in the computed absolute free energies of hydration are 1.1 kcal/mol for the 6-31G* EPS charges and 4.0 kcal/mol for the Mulliken charges. For the EPS charges, the largest individual errors are under 2 kcal/mol except for acetamide, in which case the error is 3.7 kcal/mol.

  abstract = {An extension of the spin-flip single excitation configuration interaction (SF-CIS) method is introduced. The extension, abbreviated as SF-XCIS, includes all configurations in which no more than one virtual level of the high spin triplet reference becomes occupied and no more than one doubly occupied level becomes vacant. The number of such configurations is quadratic with molecule size, and the method is implemented in a direct algorithm whose cost scales in the same way with molecule size as CIS itself, thus permitting applications to large systems. Starting from a spin restricted triplet determinant, SF-XCIS yields spin-pure singlet, triplet, and quintet states, and treats both half-occupied reference orbitals in a fully balanced way to allow application to strongly correlated problems. Tests on bond dissociation in the HF molecule, the torsional potential of ethylene, and excited states of polyenes show encouraging improvements using SF-XCIS compared to SF-CIS and a previously suggested extension, the spin-complete CIS model.}

Even at this early stage, it has enabled the solution of many problems that would previously have been intractable with any other method, in particular, multireference problems with very large active spaces. Historically, the DMRG was not originally formulated from a wavefunction perspective, but rather in a Renormalisation Group (RG) language. However, it is now realised that a wavefunction view of the DMRG provides a more convenient, and in some cases more powerful, paradigm. Here we provide an expository introduction to the DMRG ansatz in the context of quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {Atomic partial charges are among the most commonly used interpretive tools in quantum chemistry. Dozens of different `population analyses' are in use, which are best seen as proxies (indirect gauges) rather than measurements of a `general ionicity'. For the GMTKN55 benchmark of nearly 2,500 main-group molecules, which span a broad swathe of chemical space, some two dozen different charge distributions were evaluated at the PBE0 level near the 1-particle basis set limit. The correlation matrix between the different charge distributions exhibits a block structure; blocking is, broadly speaking, by charge distribution class. A principal component analysis on the entire dataset suggests that nearly all variation can be accounted for by just two `principal components of ionicity': one has all the distributions going in sync, while the second corresponds mainly to Bader QTAIM vs. all others. A weaker third component corresponds to electrostatic charge models in opposition to the orbital-based ones. The single charge distributions that have the greatest statistical similarity to the first principal component are iterated Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-I) and a minimal-basis projected modification of Bickelhaupt charges. If three individual variables, rather than three principal components, are to be identified that contain most of the information in the whole dataset, one representative for each of the three classes of Corminboeuf et al. is needed: one based on partitioning of the density (such as QTAIM), a second based on orbital partitioning (such as NPA), and a third based on the molecular electrostatic potential (such as HLY or CHELPG).},

A hierarchy of coupled cluster models, CCS, CC2, CCSD, CC3, CCSDT etc., is presented where CC2 and CC3 are approximate coupled cluster models defined by similar approximations. Higher levels give increased accuracy at increased computational effort. The scaling of CCS, CC2, CCSD, CC3 and CCSDT is N4, N5, N6, N7 and N8, respectively where N is th the number of orbitals.

With the current shift to more complex deep learning models, in many situations that utility is lost. In this work, we expand on our previously work on computational thermochemistry and propose an interpretable graph network, FragGraph(nodes), that provides decomposed predictions into fragment-wise contributions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model in predicting a correction to density functional theory (DFT)-calculated atomization energies using {$\Delta$}-learning. Our model predicts G4(MP2)-quality thermochemistry with an accuracy of {$<$}1 kJ mol-1 for the GDB9 dataset. Besides the high accuracy of our predictions, we observe trends in the fragment corrections which quantitatively describe the deficiencies of B3LYP. Node-wise predictions significantly outperform our previous model predictions from a global state vector. This effect is most pronounced as we explore the generality by predicting on more diverse test sets indicating node-wise predictions are less sensitive to extending machine learning models to larger molecules.},

  abstract = {We apply a new restrained electrostatic potential fit charge model (two-stage RESP) to conformational analysis and the calculation of intermolecular interactions. Specifically, we study conformational energies in butane, methyl ethyl thioether, three simple alcohols, three simple amines, and 1,2-ethanediol as a function of charge model (two-stage RESP vs standard ESP) and 1-4 electrostatic scale factor. We demonstrate that the two-stage RESP model with a 1-4 electrostatic scale factor of \textemdash 1/1.2 is a very good model, as evaluated by comparison with high-level ab initio calculations. For methanol and /V-methylacetamide interactions with TIP3P water, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds only slightly weaker than found with the standard ESP changes. In tests on DNA base pairs, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds which are \textasciitilde{} 1 kcal/mol weaker than those calculated with the standard ESP charges but closer in magnitude to the best current available ab initio calculations. Furthermore, the two-stage RESP charges, unlike the standard ESP charges, reproduce the result that Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding is stronger than Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding for adenine-thymine base pairs. The free energies of solvation of both methanol and f/ww-iV-methylacetamide were also calculated for the standard ESP and two-stage RESP models and both were in good agreement with experiment. We have combined the use of two-stage RESP charges with multiple conformational fitting\textemdash recently employed using standard ESP charges as described by Reynolds, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 9075)\textemdash in studies of conformationally dependent dipole moments and energies of propylamine. We find that the combination of these approaches is synergistic in leading to useful charge distributions for molecular simulations. Two-stage RESP charges thus reproduce both intermolecular and intramolecular energies and structures quite well, making this charge model a critical advancement in the development of a general force field for modeling biological macromolecules and their ligands, both in the gas phase and in solution.},

  abstract = {We initiate a series of works where we study the interior of dynamical rotating vacuum black holes without symmetry. In the present paper, we take up the problem starting from appropriate Cauchy data for the Einstein vacuum equations defined on a hypersurface already within the black hole interior, representing the expected geometry just inside the event horizon. We prove that for all such data, the maximal Cauchy evolution can be extended across a non-trivial piece of Cauchy horizon as a Lorentzian manifold with continuous metric. In subsequent work, we will retrieve our assumptions on data assuming only that the black hole event horizon geometry suitably asymptotes to a rotating Kerr solution. In particular, if the exterior region of the Kerr family is proven to be dynamically stable\textemdash as is widely expected\textemdash then it will follow that the C0-inextendibility formulation of Penrose's celebrated strong cosmic censorship conjecture is in fact false. The proof suggests, however, that the C0-metric Cauchy horizons thus arising are generically singular in an essential way, representing so-called ``weak null singularities'', and thus that a revised version of strong cosmic censorship holds.},

  abstract = {A common need in machine vision is to compute the 3-D rigid body transformation that aligns two sets of points for which correspondence is known. A comparative analysis is presented here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which computes the translational and rotational components of the transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the transformation representation used and the mathematical derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard [R,T] representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform. This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to degenerate data sets, and (3) relative computation time of each approach under different conditions. The results indicate that under ``ideal'' data conditions (no noise) certain distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for ``typical, real-world'' noise levels, there is no difference in the robustness of the final solutions (contrary to certain previously published results). Efficiency, in terms of execution time, is found to be highly dependent on the computer system setup.},

  abstract = {Benchmark results for spin-flip (SF) coupled-cluster and multireference (MR) methods for bond-breaking in hydrocarbons are presented. The nonparallelity errors (NPEs), which are defined as an absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the errors in the potential energy along bond-breaking curves, are analyzed for (i) the entire range of nuclear distortions from equilibrium to the dissociation limit and (ii) in the intermediate range (2.5-4.5 \AA ), which is the most relevant for kinetics modeling. For methane, the spin-flip and MR results are compared against full configuration interaction (FCI). For the entire potential energy curves, the NPEs for the SF model with single and double substitutions (SF-CCSD) are slightly less than 3 kcal/mol. Inclusion of triple excitations reduces the NPEs to 0.32 kcal/mol. The corresponding NPEs for the MR-CI are less than 1 kcal/mol, while those of multireference perturbation theory are slightly larger (1.2 kcal/mol). The NPEs in the intermediate range are smaller for all of the methods. The largest errors of 0.35 kcal/mol are observed, surprisingly, for a spin-flip approach that includes triple excitations, while MR-CI, CASPT2, and SF-CCSD curves are very close to each other and are within 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol of FCI. For a larger basis set, the difference between MR-CI and CASPT2 is about 0.2 kcal/mol, while SF-CCSD is within 0.4 kcal/mol of MR-CI. For the C-C bond breaking in ethane, the results of the SF-CCSD are within 1 kcal/mol of MR-CI for the entire curve and within 0.4 kcal/mol in the intermediate region. The corresponding NPEs for CASPT2 are 1.8 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Including the effect of triples by energy-additivity schemes is found to be insignificant for the intermediate region. For the entire range of nuclear separations, sufficiently large basis sets are required to avoid artifacts at small internuclear separations.},

Topics covered in the book include: * Second quantization with spin adaptation * Gaussian basis sets and molecular-integral evaluation * Hartree-Fock theory * Configuration-interaction and multi-configurational self-consistent theory * Coupled-cluster theory for ground and excited states * Perturbation theory for single- and multi-configurational states * Linear-scaling techniques and the fast multipole method * Explicity correlated wave functions * Basis-set convergence and extrapolation * Calibration and benchmarking of computational methods, with applications to moelcular equilibrium structure, atomization energies and reaction enthalpies. Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory makes extensive use of numerical examples, designed to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each method treated. In addition, statements about the usefulness and deficiencies of the various methods are supported by actual examples, not just model calculations. Problems and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, complete with hints and solutions. This book is a must for researchers in the field of quantum chemistry as well as for nonspecialists who wish to acquire a thorough understanding of ab initio molecular electronic-structure theory and its applications to problems in chemistry and physics. It is also highly recommended for the teaching of graduates and advanced undergraduates.},

  abstract = {Multipole moments such as charge, dipole, and quadrupole are often invoked to rationalize intermolecular phenomena, but a low-order multipole expansion is rarely a valid description of electrostatics at the length scales that characterize nonbonded interactions. This is illustrated by examining several common misunderstandings rooted in erroneous electrostatic arguments. First, the notion that steric repulsion originates in Coulomb interactions is easily disproved by dissecting the interaction potential for Ar2. Second, the Hunter-Sanders model of {$\pi-\pi$} interactions, which is based on quadrupolar electrostatics, is shown to have no basis in accurate calculations. Third, curved ``buckybowls'' exhibit unusually large dipole moments, but these are ancillary to the forces that control their intermolecular interactions, as illustrated by two examples involving corannulene. Finally, the assumption that interactions between water and small anions are dictated by the dipole moment of H2O is shown to be false in the case of binary halide-water complexes. These examples present a compelling case that electrostatic explanations based on low-order multipole moments are very often counterfactual for nonbonded interactions at close range and should not be taken seriously in the absence of additional justification.},

  abstract = {Selected points on the potential energy surface for the complexes Rg@C60 (Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr) are calculated with various theoretical methods, like symmetry-adapted perturbation theory with monomers described by density functional theory (DFT-SAPT), supermolecular M\o ller\textendash Plesset theory truncated on the second order (MP2), spin-component-scaled MP2 (SCS-MP2), supermolecular density functional theory with empirical dispersion correction (DFT+Disp), and the recently developed MP2C method that improves the MP2 method for long-range electron correlation effects. A stabilization of the endohedral complex is predicted by all methods, but the depth of the potential energy well is overestimated by the DFT+Disp and MP2 approaches. On the other hand, the MP2C model agrees well with DFT-SAPT, which serves as the reference. The performance of SCS-MP2 is mixed: it produces too low interaction energies for the two heavier guests, while its accuracy for He@C60 and Ne@C60 is similar to that of MP2C. Fitting formulas for the main interaction energy components, i.e. the dispersion and first-order repulsion energies are proposed, which are applicable for both endo- and exohedral cases. For all examined methods density fitting is used to evaluate two-electron repulsion integrals, which is indispensable to allow studies of noncovalent complexes of this size. It has been found that density-fitting auxiliary basis sets cannot be used in a black-box fashion for the calculation of the first-order SAPT electrostatic energy, and that the quality of these basis sets should be always carefully examined in order to avoid an unphysical long-range behavior.},

  abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 \texttimes{} 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

  abstract = {The interaction between sunlight and drugs can lead to phototoxicity in patients who have received such drugs. Phototoxicity assessment is a regulatory requirement globally and one of the main toxicity screening steps in the early stages of drug discovery. An in silico-in vitro approach has been utilized mainly for toxicology assessments at these stages. Although several quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for phototoxicity have been developed, in silico technology to evaluate phototoxicity has not been well established. In this study, we attempted to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the in vitro Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test results from a chemical structure and its derived information. To accomplish this, we utilized an open-source software library, kMoL. kMoL employs a graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) approach, which allows it to learn the data for the specified chemical structure. kMoL also utilizes the integrated gradient (IG) method, enabling it to visually display the substructures contributing to any positive results. To construct this AI model, we used only the chemical structure as a basis, then added the descriptors and the HOMO-LUMO gap, which was obtained from quantum chemical calculations. As a result, the assortment of chemical structures and the HOMO-LUMO gap produced an AI model with high discrimination performance, and an F1 score of 0.857. Additionally, our AI model could visualize the substructures involved in phototoxicity using the IG method. Our AI model can be applied as a toxicity screening method and could enhance productivity in drug development.},

  abstract = {This paper presents our vision of how to use in silico approaches to extract the reaction mechanisms and kinetic parameters for complex condensed-phase chemical processes that underlie important technologies ranging from combustion to chemical vapor deposition. The goal is to provide an analytic description of the detailed evolution of a complex chemical system from reactants through various intermediates to products, so that one could optimize the efficiency of the reactive processes to produce the desired products and avoid unwanted side products. We could start with quantum mechanics (QM) to ensure an accurate description; however, to obtain useful kinetics we need to average over {$\sim$}10-nm spatial scales for {$\sim$}1 ns, which is prohibitively impractical with QM. Instead, we use the reactive force field (ReaxFF) trained to fit QM to carry out the reactive molecular dynamics (RMD). We focus here on showing that it is practical to extract from such RMD the reaction mechanisms and kinetics information needed to describe the reactions analytically. This analytic description can then be used to incorporate the correct reaction chemistry from the QM/ReaxFF atomistic description into larger-scale simulations of {$\sim$}10 nm to micrometers to millimeters to meters using analytic approaches of computational fluid dynamics and/or continuum chemical dynamics. In the paper we lay out the strategy to extract the mechanisms and rate parameters automatically without the necessity of knowing any details of the chemistry. We consider this to be a proof of concept. We refer to the process as RMD2Kin (reactive molecular dynamics to kinetics) for the general approach and as ReaxMD2Kin (ReaxFF molecular dynamics to kinetics) for QM-ReaxFF\textendash based reaction kinetics.},

We then focus on a more traditional metric based on dominant weights in the full configuration solution and discuss its behavior with respect to the choice of the N-electron and the one-electron basis. The impact of symmetry is discussed, and we emphasize that the distinction among determinants, configuration state functions and configurations as reference functions is useful because the latter incorporate spin-coupling into the reference and should thus reduce the complexity of the wave function expansion. The corresponding notions of single determinant, single spin-coupling and single configuration wave functions are discussed and the effect of orbital rotations on the multireference character is reviewed by analyzing a simple model system. In molecular systems, the extent of correlation effects should be limited by finite system size and in most cases the appropriate choices of one-electron and N-electron bases should be able to incorporate these into a lowcomplexity reference function, often a single configurational one.},

To illustrate its performance, the revised Das function was implemented in the multipole first-order electrostatic and second-order dispersion (MED) scoring model. The extension has allowed applications to a much larger set of biocomplexes than it was possible with the original Das. A reasonable correlation between MED and experimentally determined inhibitory activities was achieved in a number of test cases, including structures featuring nonphysically shortened intermonomer distances, which constitute a particular challenge for binding strength predictions. Since the MED model is also computationally efficient, it can be used for reliable and rapid assessment of the ligand affinity or multidimensional scanning of amino acid side-chain conformations in the process of rational design of novel drugs or biocatalysts.},

  abstract = {Light-driven [2+2] cycloaddition is the most direct strategy to build tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes, core components of many lead compounds for drug development. Significant advances in the chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity of [2+2] photocycloadditions have been made, but exceptional and tunable diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity (head-to-head versus head-to-tail adducts) is required for the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Here we show that colloidal quantum dots serve as visible-light chromophores, photocatalysts and reusable scaffolds for homo- and hetero-intermolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions of 4-vinylbenzoic acid derivatives, including aryl-conjugated alkenes, with up to 98\% switchable regioselectivity and 98\% diastereoselectivity for the previously minor syn-cyclobutane products. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that our system demonstrates catalysis triggered by triplet\textendash triplet energy transfer from the quantum dot. The precisely controlled triplet energy levels of the quantum dot photocatalysts facilitate efficient and selective heterocoupling, a major challenge in direct cyclobutane synthesis.},

  abstract = {Triplet excited state chemistry has enabled a range of important organic transformations by accessing reaction pathways inaccessible to photoredox chemistry. Such photoreactions are triggered by triplet photosensitizers, which absorb visible-light photons and transfer the energy to the substrate or to a co-catalyst through triplet\textendash triplet energy transfer (TT EnT). The most popular triplet photosensitizers, metal complexes and organic chromophores, have proven useful in a range of pericyclic reactions, bond dissociations, and isomerizations, but they have several characteristics related to their chemical and electronic structure that limit their selectivity, energy efficiency, and sustainability. This Perspective describes some ways that colloidal quantum dots (QDs) address the limitations of molecular photocatalysts for TT EnT-driven organic transformations. These sub-5-nm particles have the large catalytic surface area and electronic/optical tunability of homogeneous catalysts, and the easy separation and surface templating effects of heterogeneous catalysts. Their optical and electronic properties, small singlet\textendash triplet energy splitting, narrow emission line widths, and high photostability enhance their performance as triplet photosensitizers. This Perspective describes these advantages in the context of published and ongoing investigations of TT EnT-driven reactions, and then highlights the advantages and challenges associated with using related emerging materials, specifically lead halide perovskite QDs and quasi-2D nanoplatelets, as photocatalysts for triplet excited state chemistry.},

Bader charge analysis is first performed to analyze the surface atomic partial charges. The CH4 adsorption densities in defective and functionalized graphite slit pores are lower than that in the perfect pore according to the MD simulations. Finally, the CH4 adsorption isotherms for the perfect, defective and functionalized slit pores are analyzed by the GCMC simulations in combination of the DFT and MD results. For pores with defective surface, the adsorption capacities decrease; while the embedded functional groups decrease the adsorption capacity at low pressure and enhance it at high pressure. Our results demonstrate the significant effects of chemical and structural surface heterogeneity on the CH4 adsorption and provide a systematic approach to understand the gas adsorption behaviour.},

  abstract = {We report an ab initio study of the effect of vinyl substitution on the cycloaromatization of 3-ene-1,5-diynes (the Bergman cyclization). The majority of the calculations were conducted by using the BLYP version of Density Functional Theory, and higher level Brueckner orbital calculations were used for a few key compounds. In all, 46 enediynes, 44 cyclization transition states, 39 singlet p-benzynes, and 28 related triplet p-benzynes were studied, including simple vinyl-substituted and annulated examples. The data indicate that strongly electron-withdrawing groups increase the cyclization barrier, while {$\sigma$}-donating groups decrease it; {$\pi$} conjugation, especially donation, has little effect. Most annulations, including those involving heteroaromatic rings, lower the barrier slightly (6 MR) or raise it slightly (5 MR). Larger effects are seen for smaller rings or charged rings. Some previously observed apparent rate inhibitions are seen to be due to reversibility or forward reactivity of the intermediate p-benzynes, which are thereby inhibited from the H abstraction step that completes cycloaromatization. H abstraction reactivity, as judged from the p-benzyne singlet-triplet energy gap and from isodesmic equations, is also examined. Unexpected behavior is predicted for some heteroaromatic systems. Finally, we anticipate how these results may be applied to the design of prodrug candidates for subsequent biological application.},

  abstract = {Modern quantum chemistry can make quantitative predictions on an immense array of chemical systems. However, the interpretation of those predictions is often complicated by the complex wave function expansions used. Here we show that an exceptionally simple algebraic construction allows for defining atomic core and valence orbitals, polarized by the molecular environment, which can exactly represent self-consistent field wave functions. This construction provides an unbiased and direct connection between quantum chemistry and empirical chemical concepts, and can be used, for example, to calculate the nature of bonding in molecules, in chemical terms, from first principles. In particular, we find consistency with electronegativities ({$\chi$}), C 1s core-level shifts, resonance substituent parameters ({$\sigma$}R), Lewis structures, and oxidation states of transition-metal complexes.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing scientific and engineering disciplines owing to its ability to capture hidden patterns in large amounts of data. The recent success of ML can be attributed to increasing amount of data, simulation resources, and improving understanding of statistical inference. For these reasons computational materials science is undergoing a paradigm shift. The main reason is that trial-and-error approach to materials design is inefficient: laboratory trials require a lot of time, and the results of previous trials are not utilized in a systematic fashion. A data-driven approach, which draws upon all relevant data from experiments, and reactive and quantum molecular dynamics simulations, can address these issues. The MAGICS (Materials Genome Innovation for Computational Software) Center develops to aid the synthesis of stacked layered materials by chemical vapor deposition, exfoliation, and intercalation. The identification of different phases is a classification problem and can be solved using ML techniques. We have used feed-forward neural network with three hidden layers to identify the different phases present during computational synthesis of MoSe2. Our goal is to carry out exascale MD simulations using forces for multimillion-atom quantum dynamics simulations from neural networks and deep learning using small QMD simulations.},

It focuses on applications of EOM-CC to electronically excited and open-shell species. The examples emphasize EOM's advantages for selected situations often perceived as multireference cases [e.g., interacting states of different nature, Jahn-Teller (JT) and pseudo-JT states, dense manifolds of ionized states, diradicals, and triradicals].

Current QD sensitizers often contain toxic elements such as Cd and Pb. In order to ``go green'' with these sensitizers, we investigate triplet energy transfer from InP-based QDs. Time-resolved spectroscopy studies revealed picosecond hole trapping in core-only QDs, which could complicate and/or inhibit energy transfer. We therefore developed InP/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs that effectively suppressed hole trapping and meanwhile allowed for triplet energy transfer to surfaceanchored anthracene acceptors with an efficiency of 84\%. The sensitized molecular triplets participated in triplet-tripletannihilation, enabling photon upconversion with a normalized quantum yield reaching 10.0\% {$\pm$} 0.1\%. This study demonstrates that nontoxic InP-based QDs can be engineered to be on par with state-of-the-art Cd- or Pb-containing QDs for use as triplet sensitizers.},

Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle- Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.},

  abstract = {The use of the mixed reference (MR) reduced density matrix, which combines reduced density matrices of the MS = +1 and -1 triplet-ground states, is proposed in the context of the collinear spin-flip-time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT) methodology. The time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with the mixed state is solved by the use of spinor-like open-shell orbitals within the linear response formalism, which enables to generate additional configurations in the realm of TD-DFT. The resulting MR-SF-TDDFT computational scheme has several advantages before the conventional collinear SF-TDDFT. The spin-contamination of the response states of SF-TDDFT is nearly removed. This considerably simplifies the identification of the excited states, especially in the ``black-box'' type applications, such as the automatic geometry optimization, reaction path following, or molecular dynamics simulations. With the new methodology, the accuracy of the description of the excited states is improved as compared to the collinear SF-TDDFT. Several test examples, which include systems typified by strong non-dynamic correlation, orbital (near) degeneracy, and conical intersections, are given to illustrate the performance of the new method.}

Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation, for generic chemical problems where heuristic quantum state preparation might be assumed to be efficient. The availability of exponential quantum advantage then centers on whether features of the physical problem that enable efficient heuristic quantum state preparation also enable efficient solution by classical heuristics. Through numerical studies of quantum state preparation and empirical complexity analysis (including the error scaling) of classical heuristics, in both ab initio and model Hamiltonian settings, we conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for ground-state quantum chemistry through polynomial speedups, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem.},

By means of dispersion-corrected density functional theory computations, we demonstrated that considerable CH/{$\pi$} interactions exist between graphene and its fully (graphane) or patterned partially (C4H) hydrogenated derivatives. Due to the equivalence breaking of two sublattices of graphene, a 90 meV band gap is opened in the graphene/C4H bilayer. The band gap can be further increased to 270 meV by sandwiching graphene between two C4H layers. By taking advantage of the similar SiH/ {$\pi$} interactions, a 120 meV band gap also can be opened for silicene. Interestingly, the high carrier mobility of graphene/silicene can be well-preserved. Our theoretical results suggest a rather practical solution for gap opening of graphene and silicene, which would allow them to serve as field effect transistors and other nanodevices.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most important tools for investigating the excited states of electrons. The TDDFT calculation for spin-conserving excitation, where collinear functionals are sufficient, has obtained great success and has become routine. However, TDDFT for noncollinear and spin-flip excitations, where noncollinear functionals are needed, is less widespread and still a challenge nowadays. This challenge lies in the severe numerical instabilities that root in the second-order derivatives of commonly used noncollinear functionals. To be free from this problem radically, noncollinear functionals with numerical stable derivatives are desired, and our recently developed approach, called the multicollinear approach, provides an option. In this work, the multicollinear approach is implemented in noncollinear and spin-flip TDDFT, and prototypical tests are given.}

  abstract = {Fragment-based methods promise accurate energetics at a cost that scales linearly with the number of fragments. This promise is founded on the premise that the many-body expansion (or another similar energy decomposition) needs to only consider spatially local many-body interactions. Experience and chemical intuition suggest that typically at most four-body interactions are required for high accuracy. Bettens and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014 9, 3699\textemdash 3707] published a detailed study showing that for moderately sized water clusters, basis set superposition error (BSSE) undermines this premise. Ultimately, they were able to overcome BSSE by performing all computations in the supersystem basis set, but such a solution destroys the reduced computational scaling of fragment-based methods. Their findings led them to suggest that there is ``trouble with the many-body expansion''. Since then, a subsequent follow-up study from Bettens and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory. Comput. 2015, 11, 5132\textendash 5143] as well as a related study by Mayer and Bak\'o [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017, 13, 1883\textemdash 1886] have proposed new frameworks for understanding BSSE in the many-body expansion. Although the two frameworks ultimately propose the same working set of equations to the BSSE problem, their interpretations are quite different, even disagreeing on whether or not the solution is an approximation. In this work we propose a more general BSSE framework. We then show that, somewhat paradoxically, the two interpretations are compatible and amount to two different ``normalization'' conditions. Finally, we consider applications of these BSSE frameworks to small water clusters, where we focus on replicating high-accuracy coupled cluster benchmarks. Ultimately, we show for water clusters, using the present framework, that one can obtain results that are within {$\pm$}0.5 kcal mol\textendash 1 of the coupled cluster complete basis set limit without considering anymore than a correlated three-body computation in a quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis set and a four-body triple-{$\zeta$} Hartree\textendash Fock computation.},

However, the use of partial atomic charges remains relatively uncommon in the characterization of excited-state electronic structure. Here, we show how wellestablished partial atomic charge methods perform for interatomic, intermolecular, and interbond electron transfer in electronically excited states. Our results demonstrate the utility of real-space partial atomic charges for interpreting the electronic structures that arise in excited-state processes. Furthermore, we show how this analysis can be used to demonstrate that analogous electronic structures arise near photochemically relevant conical intersection regions for several conjugated polyenes. On the basis of our analysis, we find that charges computed using the iterative Hirshfeld approach provide results which are consistent with chemical intuition and are transferable between homologous molecular systems.},

One example is the presence of a {$\pi$}-electron-deficient cavity in halogen-substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds, the so-called {$\pi$}-holes, the existence of which was predicted theoretically, but the direct experimental observation is still missing. Here we present the resolution of the {$\pi$}-hole on a single molecule using the Kelvin probe force microscopy, which confirms the theoretical prediction of its existence. In addition, experimental measurements supported by theoretical calculations show the importance of {$\pi$}-holes in the process of adsorption of molecules on solid-state surfaces. This study expands our understanding of the {$\pi$}-hole systems and, at the same time, opens up possibilities for studying the influence of submolecular charge distribution on the chemical properties of molecules and their mutual interaction.},

Phys. 104, 2149 (2006)] derived within method-of-moments framework and is not size intensive. The spin-flip variant of the correction is size intensive. The performance of the correction is demonstrated by calculations of electronic excitation energies in methylene, nitrenium ion, cyclobutadiene, ortho-, meta-, and para-benzynes, 1,2,3-tridehydrobenzene, as well as C\textendash C bond breaking in ethane. In all cases except cyclobutadiene, the absolute values of the correction for energy differences were 0.1 eV or less. In cyclobutadiene, the absolute values of the correction were as large as 0.4 eV. In most cases, the correction reduced the errors against the benchmark values by about a factor of 2\textendash 3, the absolute errors being less than 0.04 eV.},

Equations are given for the covariance matrix of the attitude estimate, as well as for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix, in terms of the singular value decomposition matrices. The singular value decomposition method is compared with Shuster's implementation of Davenport's q-method, which is more efficient than the new algorithm but does not give the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. These are often useful for analysis, since the maximum eigenvalue and its eigenvector give the magnitude and direction of the largest component of the attitude uncertainty.},

This method is still based on the Cartesian coordinate system and can be used in place of SHAKE and RATTLE. We implemented this algorithm in the SPASMS package of molecular mechanics and dynamics. Several series of molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to examine the performance of the new algorithm in comparison with the original RATTLE method. It was found that SETTLE is of higher accuracy and is faster than RATTLE with reasonable tolerances by three to nine times on a scalar machine. Furthermore, the performance improvement ranged from factors of 26 to 98 on a vector machine since the method presented is not iterative. \textcopyright{} 1992 by John Wiley \{\&\vphantom\}}

A simple and attractive for- mulation is the lock-and-key analogy defining the host as a lock accommodating the guest as a key. We stress three major aspects of molecular recognition, determining both complementarity between host and guest and similarity within a group of guest molecules. These aspects are: steric, i.e. maximization of close contacts, electrostatic, i.e. maximization of electrostatic attraction between host and guest, as well as hydrophobic, i.e. avoiding hydrophobic hydration, which can be reached by the maximization of apolar contacts between interacting molecules. Some examples are presented from our laboratory: the complexes of acylaminoacyl peptidase with small peptides, the effect of heparin binding on inhibitory potency of C1- inhibitor as well as small-molecule ligand binding to prolyl oligopeptidase and calmodulin.},

  abstract = {Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, underpinning the properties and reactivity of many organic compounds and materials. The ability to easily and accurately discern aromatic behavior is key to leveraging it as a design element, yet most aromaticity metrics struggle to combine accurate quantitative evaluation, intuitive interpretability, and user-friendliness. We introduce a new method, NICS2BC, which uses simple and inexpensive NICS calculations to generate information-rich and easily-interpreted bond-current graphs. We test the quantitative and qualitative characterizations afforded by NICS2BC for a selection of molecules of varying structural and electronic complexity, to demonstrate its accuracy and ease of analysis. Moreover, we show that NICS2BC successfully identifies ring-current patterns in molecules known to be difficult cases to interpret with NICS and enables deeper understanding of local aromaticity trends, demonstrating that our method adds additional insight.},

Instead, the enhancement is found to originate from many intermediate-range contacts distributed throughout the binding pocket, particularly including the peptide bonds in the protein backbone. The contributions from these contacts are primarily electrostatic in nature, but require ab initio computations involving nearly the full drug\textendash protein pocket system to be accurately quantified.},

The approach works well when the approximate DFT is sufficiently accurate to describe the energetics of the low-level subsystem and the coupling between subsystems. It is also necessary that the low-level DFT produces a qualitatively reasonable description of the total density, and in this work, we study model systems where delocalization error prevents this from being the case. We find substantial errors in embedding calculations on open-shell doublet systems in which self-interaction errors cause spurious delocalization of the singly occupied orbital. We propose a solution to this error by evaluating the DFT energy using a more accurate self-consistent density, such as that of Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. These so-called WF-in-(HF-DFT) calculations show excellent convergence towards full-system wavefunction calculations.},

  abstract = {Extensive time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) and DFT/multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations are performed on the singlet and triplet excited states of free-base porphyrin, with emphasis on intersystem crossing processes. The equilibrium geometries, as well as the vertical and adiabatic excitation energies of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states are determined. Single and double proton-transfer reactions in the first excited singlet state are explored. Harmonic vibrational frequencies are calculated at the equilibrium geometries of the ground state and of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states. Furthermore, spin\textendash orbit coupling matrix elements of the lowest singlet and triplet states and their numerical derivatives with respect to nuclear displacements are computed. It is shown that opening of an unprotonated pyrrole ring as well as excited-state single and double proton transfer inside the porphyrin cavity lead to crossings of the potential energy curves of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states. It is also found that displacements along out-of-plane normal modes of the first excited singlet state cause a significant increase of the {$<$}T2|Hso|S1{$>$}, {$<$}T1|Hso|S1{$>$}, and {$<$}T1|Hso|S0{$>$} spin\textendash orbit coupling matrix elements. These phenomena lead to efficient radiationless deactivation of the lowest excited states of free-base porphyrin via intercombination conversion. In particular, the S1\textrightarrow T1 population transfer is found to proceed at a rate of {$\approx$}107 s-1 in the isolated molecule.},

  abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

It is intended for the testing of accurate computational methods which are then used as a benchmark in larger model systems. In this work, we improve the best estimate of the interaction energies in the set by updating their CCSD(T)/CBS and CCSDT(Q) components with calculations in larger basis sets. The data set is then used to test a large number of composite CCSD(T) approaches. Special attention is paid to the use of the explicitly correlated MP2-F12 method in these composite calculations. It is shown that an accuracy of 1\textendash 2\% can be achieved with setups applicable to larger molecules. The effect of frozen natural orbital approximation on the accuracy of composite CCSD(T)/CBS calculations is also quantified. In four trivially saturated complexes where CCSDT(Q)/CBS data are now available, the convergence of the many-body correlation effects is assessed by fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculations. A good agreement is achieved between FN-DMC and high-level coupled-cluster which represents an important cross-check of both approaches.},

  abstract = {Recently, the first mixed C/P phosphatetrahedranes (tBuC)3P and (tBuCP)2 were reported. Unlike (tBuCP)2, (tBuC)3P exhibits remarkable thermal stability, which can be partially attributed to a network of nine hydrogen\textendash hydrogen bonds (HHBs) localized between the tert-butyl substituents. The stabilizing contribution arising from this network of HHBs was obtained from local energy decomposition (LED) analysis calculated at the domain-based local pair natural orbital CCSD(T) (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) level of theory. These calculations suggest that each HHB contributes approximately -0.7 kcal/mol of stabilization; however, the net stabilization energy likely lies between -0.25 and -0.5 kcal/mol because of steric repulsion. Spatial analysis of the London dispersion energy via a dispersion interaction density (DID) plot reveals that the DID surface is localized at key C\textendash H groups involved in HHBs, consistent with London dispersion interactions predominantly arising from HHBs. In addition, we present a computed mechanism that supports a phosphinidenoid species as a key reaction intermediate in the synthesis of (tBuC)3P.},

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1{$\Sigma$}+g, 3{$\Sigma$}+u and 3{$\Pi$}g) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) \AA; \$\o mega\$e: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm\textbackslash textminus1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

  abstract = {The valence bond (VB) theory uses localized orbitals, and its wave function is composed of a linear combination of various VB structures which are based on sets of spin functions. The VB structures are not unique, and different sets are used, Rumer sets being the most common for classical VB due to their advantage as being both easily obtained as linearly independent and meaningful. Yet, Rumer rules, which are responsible for the simplified process of obtaining the Rumer sets, are very restrictive. Furthermore, Rumer sets are best suited for cyclic systems; however, in noncyclic systems, structures resulting from Rumer rules are often not the most intuitive/suitable structures for these systems. We have developed a method to obtain chemically insightful structures, which is based on concepts of chemical bonding. The method provides sets of VB structures with improved chemical insight, which can also be controlled. Parallel to the Rumer structures, the chemical insight sets of structures are based on electron pair coupling, and hence, pictorially can be drawn similarly to the Lewis structures. Yet, different from Rumer rules, the chemical insight method, being more flexible, allows larger combinations of bonds as well as larger combinations of structures in the sets it offers, resulting in many more possible sets that are better adapted to the systems studied.},

Overcrowded systems are known to undergo geometric deformations, but the energetically favourable {$\pi$}-electron delocalization of their aromatic ring(s) is typically preserved. In this study we incremented the strain energy of an aromatic system beyond its aromatic stabilization energy, causing it to rearrange and its aromaticity to be ruptured. We noted that increasing the steric bulk around the periphery of {$\pi$}-extended tropylium rings leads them to deviate from planarity to form contorted conformations in which aromatic stabilization and strain are close in energy. Under increasing strain, the aromatic {$\pi$}-electron delocalization of the system is broken, leading to the formation of a non-aromatic, bicyclic analogue referred to as `Dewar tropylium'. The aromatic and non-aromatic isomers have been found to exist in rapid equilibrium with one another. This investigation demarcates the extent of steric deformation tolerated by an aromatic carbocycle and thus provides direct experimental insights into the fundamental nature of aromaticity.},

  abstract = {A review of the various possible definitions of diradicals leads the authors to describe these systems as having two odd electrons in degenerate or nearly-degenerate molecular orbitals. A study of the wave-function for the two odd electrons shows that its form depends entirely on whether the diradical is homo- or heterosymmetric. Energy schemes are given in these two cases, as well as in the intermediate ``non-symmetric'' case. The extent of zwitterionic character in diradical states is also investigated. This is followed by a discussion of intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet diradical states via spin-orbit coupling and other mechanisms. The electronic matrix elements for spin-orbit coupling are calculated and evaluated numerically for various model cases. It is then possible to establish general rules for favorable (electronic) intersystem crossing. In 1,3 or 1,4 diradicals its efficiency is estimated to be comparable with that in aromatics. The role of the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction in mixing singlet and triplet states, particularly in CIDNP, is explained. Finally the question of whether diradicals actually occur as secondary minima on potential energy surfaces is examined. Recent quantum-mechanical calculations, in contradiction to some thermochemical and kinetic evidence, lead to flat singlet surfaces without significant minima.},

The emphasis is on optimizations using quasi-Newton methods that rely on energy gradients, and the discussion includes Hessian updating, line searches, trust radius, and rational function optimization techniques. Single-ended and double-ended methods are discussed for transition state searches. Single-ended techniques include quasi-Newton, reduced gradient following and eigenvector following methods. Double-ended methods include nudged elastic band, string, and growing string methods. The discussions conclude with methods for validating transition states and following steepest descent reaction paths. \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

This algorithm has achieved unprecedented precision in the description of one-dimensional quantum systems. It has therefore quickly become the method of choice for numerical studies of such systems. Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by the DMRG.},

Pure DFT methods work reasonably well for these reactions; the errors are somewhat larger (ca. 3-7 kcal mol-1) than for the much more time-consuming complete active space (CASPT2) and coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] (both in error by ca. 2 kcal mol-1) methods with high-quality basis sets. The hybrid method B3LYP is unsuitable for this type of chemistry (errors of 14-20 kcal mol-1). The singlet-triplet energy separations ({$\Delta$}EST) for p-benzynes are underestimated systematically by about 2 kcal mol-1 at BLYP; the {$\Delta$}EST of 2-methyl-p-benzyne (-3.1 kcal mol-1) is close to that of p-benzyne (-3.8 kcal mol-1, i.e., singlet ground state) but the 2,3-dimethyl-p-benzyne {$\Delta$}EST is only -0.6 kcal mol-1 due to singlet destabilization (methyl repulsion). 2,3-Dialkyl-p-benzynes thus have nearly degenerate singlet and triplet states. While we find that there is clearly no predictive relationship between the alkyne carbon distance (d) and the cyclization activation enthalpy ({$\Delta$}H{$\thermod$}) for monocyclic enediynes, Nicolaou's empirically determined ``critical range'' of 3.31-3.2 \AA, where spontaneous cyclization should occur at room temperature, should be extended to 3.4-2.9 \AA. However, ring strain effects may become more important than distance arguments. Dimethyl substitution increases the endothermicity of the Bergman reaction (by about 12 kcal mol-1). The cyclization of a nine-membered enediyne is only mildly endothermic; larger rings give larger endothermicities. The formation of final products via double hydrogen abstraction from 1,4-cyclohexadiene is highly exothermic. The exothermicity decreases with increasing ring size due to unfavorable H{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H repulsion in the products.},

  abstract = {A tenure-track position at a primarily undergraduate university (PUI) is highly rewarding, but can also be stressful with many new obligations and responsibilities that faculty were not necessarily prepared for during their graduate studies or postdoctoral fellowships. In particular, PUI computational chemists are likely to be the only computational experts in their department, and thus may not have access to experienced mentors to offer advice on establishing and maintaining a successful research group specializing in computational chemistry. In this chapter, we offer faculty beginning a tenure-track position advice and guidance on how to setup a young research lab. We describe several important considerations that faculty must contemplate as they start their labs. Furthermore, we detail different likely scenarios that faculty might encounter based on varying levels of financial, technical, and administrative support at a PUI and how faculty should proceed with establishing a new lab based on their specific situation. Finally, we provide advice for new faculty on how to recruit and train new students, as well as other important decisions faculty must make when trying to build a productive research group. This chapter provides a clear list of the most important aspects of creating a new computational chemistry research group to help new tenure-track faculty get started and be successful in the short- and long-term.},

  abstract = {The cost of calculating nuclear hessians, either analytically or by finite difference methods, during the course of quantum chemical analyses can be prohibitive for systems containing hundreds of atoms. In many applications, though, only a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and not the full hessian, are required. For instance, the lowest one or two eigenvalues of the full hessian are sufficient to characterize a stationary point as a minimum or a transition state (TS), respectively. We describe here a method that can eliminate the need for hessian calculations for both the characterization of stationary points as well as searches for saddle points. A finite differences implementation of the Davidson method that uses only first derivatives of the energy to calculate the lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hessian is discussed. This method can be implemented in conjunction with geometry optimization methods such as partitioned-rational function optimization (P-RFO) to characterize stationary points on the potential energy surface. With equal ease, it can be combined with interpolation methods that determine TS guess structures, such as the freezing string method, to generate approximate hessian matrices in lieu of full hessians as input to P-RFO for TS optimization. This approach is shown to achieve significant cost savings relative to exact hessian calculation when applied to both stationary point characterization as well as TS optimization. The basic reason is that the present approach scales one power of system size lower since the rate of convergence is approximately independent of the size of the system. Therefore, the finite-difference Davidson method is a viable alternative to full hessian calculation for stationary point characterization and TS search particularly when analytical hessians are not available or require substantial computational effort.},

  abstract = {Abstract Highly correlated configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions going beyond the simple singles and doubles (CISD) model space can provide very reliable potential energy surfaces, describe electronic excited states, and yield benchmark energies and molecular properties for use in calibrating more approximate methods. Unfortunately, such wavefunctions are also notoriously difficult to evaluate due to their extreme computational demands. The dimension of a full CI procedure, which represents the exact solution of the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for a fixed one-particle basis set, grows factorially with the number of electrons and basis functions. For very large configuration spaces, the number of CI coupling coefficients becomes prohibitively large to store on disk; these coefficients must be evaluated as needed in a so-called direct CI procedure. Work done by several groups since 1980 has focused on using Slater determinants rather than spin ( S \^ 2 ) eigenfunctions because coupling coefficients are easier to compute with the former. We review the fundamentals of the configuration interaction method and discuss various determinant-based CI algorithms. Additionally, we consider some applications of highly correlated CI methods.},

  abstract = {High-level quantum chemical computations have provided significant insight into the fundamental physical nature of non-covalent interactions. These studies have focused primarily on gas-phase computations of small van der Waals dimers; however, these interactions frequently take place in complex chemical environments, such as proteins, solutions, or solids. To better understand how the chemical environment affects non-covalent interactions, we have undertaken a quantum chemical study of {$\pi$}\textendash{$\pi$} interactions in an aqueous solution, as exemplified by T-shaped benzene dimers surrounded by 28 or 50 explicit water molecules. We report interaction energies (IEs) using second-order M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory, and we apply the intramolecular and functional-group partitioning extensions of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (ISAPT and F-SAPT, respectively) to analyze how the solvent molecules tune the {$\pi$}\textendash{$\pi$} interactions of the solute. For complexes containing neutral monomers, even 50 explicit waters (constituting a first and partial second solvation shell) change total SAPT IEs between the two solute molecules by only tenths of a kcal mol-1, while significant changes of up to 3~kcal mol-1 of the electrostatic component are seen for the cationic pyridinium\textendash benzene dimer. This difference between charged and neutral solutes is attributed to large non-additive three-body interactions within solvated ion-containing complexes. Overall, except for charged solutes, our quantum computations indicate that nearby solvent molecules cause very little ``tuning'' of the direct solute\textendash solute interactions. This indicates that differences in binding energies between the gas phase and solution phase are primarily indirect effects of the competition between solute\textendash solute and solute\textendash solvent interactions.},

The PAHs include benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, tetracene, pyrene, and coronene. Interaction energies are calculated using the highest level of theory and basis set available, that is, complete-basis-set extrapolated MP2 plus a conventional or explicitly correlated CCSD(T) correction in moderately sized basis sets. The results show that the singly coordinated minimum configuration observed earlier for benzene\textbackslash textminusmethane is no longer the global minimum one for naphthalene and larger PAHs. Instead, triply coordinated geometries are lower in energy. The global minimum structures for methane interacting with extended systems like graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes are likely to be triply coordinated as well. A variety of novel dispersion-including DFT approaches are compared against the wave-function-based benchmark potential energy curves. The top performer, the B3LYP functional combined with the -D3 dispersion correction, is then employed to calculate interaction energies for methane interacting with hexabenzocoronene and circumcoronene in order to estimate the methane adsorption energy on graphite. The delicate balance between dispersion and exchange in PAH\textbackslash textminusmethane interactions is elucidated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory with a DFT description of monomers. The present study provides an important benchmark for the design and tuning of more approximate methods for an accurate description of hydrocarbon physisorption on carbon nanostructures.},

  abstract = {PSI4 is a free and open-source ab initio electronic structure program providing implementations of Hartree\textendash Fock, density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, configuration interaction, density cumulant theory, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster theory. Most of the methods are quite efficient, thanks to density fitting and multi-core parallelism. The program is a hybrid of C++ and Python, and calculations may be run with very simple text files or using the Python API, facilitating post-processing and complex workflows; method developers also have access to most of PSI4's core functionalities via Python. Job specification may be passed using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) QCSCHEMA data format, facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and concomitant adoption of the MolSSI QCARCHIVE INFRASTRUCTURE project, makes the latest version of PSI4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of independent tasks. The project has fostered the development of independent software components that may be reused in other quantum chemistry programs.},

We also propose a method to obtain such charges based on a mapping from approximate electronic wave functions. The method is illustrated by parameterizing two new charge models called AM1-CM1A and PM3-CM1P, based on experimental dipole moments and, respectively, on AM1 and PM3 semiempirical electronic wave functions. These charge models yield rms errors of 0.30 and 0.26 D, respectively, in the dipole moments of a set of 195 neutral molecules consisting of 103 molecules containing H, C, N and O, covering variations of multiple common organic functional groups, 68 fluorides, chlorides, bromides and iodides, 15 compounds containing H, C, Si or S, and 9 compounds containing C-S-O or C-N-O linkages. In addition, partial charges computed with this method agree extremely well with high-level ab initio calculations for both neutral compounds and ions. The CM1 charge models provide a more accurate point charge representation of the dipole moment than provided by most previously available partial charges, and they are far less expensive to compute.},

  abstract = {This review sets out to understand the reactivity of diradicals and how that may differ from monoradicals. In the first part of the review, we delineate the electronic structure of a diradical with its two degenerate or nearly degenerate molecular orbitals, occupied by two electrons. A classification of diradicals based on whether or not the two SOMOs can be located on different sites of the molecule is useful in determining the ground state spin. Important is a delocalized to localized orbital transformation that interchanges ``closed-shell'' to ``open-shell'' descriptions. The resulting duality is useful in understanding the dual reactivity of singlet diradicals. In the second part of the review, we examine, with a consistent level of theory, activation energies of prototypical radical reactions (dimerization, hydrogen abstraction, and addition to ethylene) for representative organic diradicals and diradicaloids in their two lowest spin states. Differences and similarities in reactivity of diradicals vs monoradicals, based on either a localized or delocalized view, whichever is suitable, are then discussed. The last part of this review begins with an extensive, comparative, and critical survey of available measures of diradical character and ends with an analysis of the consequences of diradical character for selected diradicaloids.},

To ensure easy of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran based quantum chemistry programs.

  abstract = {Weakly bound non-valence anions are molecular systems where the excess electron stabilizes in a very diffuse orbital whose size, shape, and binding energy ({$\sim$}1-100 meV) are governed by the long-range electrostatic potential of the molecule. Its binding energy comes mainly from charge-dipole or charge- multipole interactions or dispersion forces. While highly correlated methods, like coupled cluster methods, are considered to be the state of the art for describing anionic systems, especially when the electron lies in a very diffuse orbital, we consider here the possibility to use DFT-based calculations. In such molecular anions, the outer electron experiences long-range exchange and correlation interactions. We show that DFT can describe longrange bound states provided that a correct asymptotic exchange and correlation potential is used, namely, that from a range-separated hybrid functional. This opens an alternative to the computationally demanding highly correlated method calculations. It is also suggested that the study of weakly bound anions could help in the construction of new DFT potentials to study systems where nonlocal effects are significant.},

  abstract = {Electron-transfers accompanied by a change in metal atom spin-state occur widely in chemistry and biology. An appropriate framework for interpreting such behavior is an electrochemical scheme of squares consisting of two one-electron electrode reactions and two spin-equilibrium steps. The presence of coupled electron-transfers and spin-exchanges is reflected in the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of such events. Oxidation\textendash reduction potentials and electron-transfer rate constants depend on the positions of the spin-state equilibria in the two oxidation states. Electrochemical activation parameters exhibit significant contributions from the large enthalpic and entropic differences that characterize spin-exchange reactions. The entropy of an electrochemical half-reaction, {$\Delta$}S\textdegree rc, coupled to a spin-exchange reflects the increases in vibrational and electronic entropy that accompany low- to high-spin conversion. Electrochemical enthalpies and entropies of activation, {$\Delta$}H\textbackslash ddag and {$\Delta$}S\textbackslash ddag, are influenced by the temperature dependence of the accompanying spin-state transitions and are useful in mechanism diagnosis. The present review describes examples from the literature and our own laboratory regarding Fe(III/II) (d5/d6) and Co(III/II) (d6/d7) couples that exhibit the above behavior.},

Recently Arun et al. and Horn et al. have presented a solution of this problem. Their solution, however, sometimes fails to give a correct rotation matrix and gives a reflection instead when the data is severely corrupted. The theorem given in this correspondence is a strict solution of the problem, and it always gives the correct transformation parameters even when the data is corrupted.},

  abstract = {Short-range repulsion within inter-molecular force fields is conventionally described by ei- ther Lennard-Jones (A/r12) or Born-Mayer (Aexp(\textbackslash textminusBr)) forms. Despite their widespread use, these simple functional forms are often unable to describe the interaction energy accurately over a broad range of inter-molecular distances, thus creating challenges in the development of ab initio force fields and potentially leading to decreased accuracy and transferability. Herein, we derive a novel short-range functional form based on a simple Slater-like model of over- lapping atomic densities and an iterated stockholder atom (ISA) partitioning of the molecular electron density. We demonstrate that this Slater-ISA methodology yields a more accurate, transferable, and robust description of the short-range interactions at minimal additional com- putational cost compared to standard Lennard-Jones or Born-Mayer approaches. Finally, we show how this methodology can be adapted to yield the standard Born-Mayer functional form while still retaining many of the advantages of the Slater-ISA approach.}

  abstract = {Atomic partial charges appear in the Coulomb term of many force-field models and can be derived from electronic structure calculations with a myriad of atoms-inmolecules (AIM) methods. More advanced models have also been proposed, using the distributed nature of the electron cloud and atomic multipoles. In this work, an electrostatic force field is defined through a concise approximation of the electron density, for which the Coulomb interaction is trivially evaluated. This approximate ``pro-density'' is expanded in a minimal basis of atom-centered s-type Slater density functions, whose parameters are optimized by minimizing the Kullback- Leibler divergence of the pro-density from a reference electron density, e.g., obtained from an electronic structure calculation. The proposed method, Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), is a variant of the Hirshfeld AIM method, but it can also be used as a density-fitting technique. An iterative algorithm to refine the pro-density is easily implemented with a linear-scaling computational cost, enabling applications to supramolecular systems. The benefits of the MBIS method are demonstrated with systematic applications to molecular databases and extended models of condensed phases. A comparison to 14 other AIM methods shows its effectiveness when modeling electrostatic interactions. MBIS is also suitable for rescaling atomic polarizabilities in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler scheme for dispersion interactions.},

The advantage of using this representation is that the method solves for the location estimate by minimizing a single cost function associated with the sum of the orientation and position errors and thus is expected to have a better performance on the estimation, both in accuracy and in speed. Several forms of sensory information can be used by the algorithm. That is, the measured data can be a combination of measured points on an object's surfaces and measured unit direction vectors located on the object. Simulations have been carried out on a Compaq 386/20 computer and the simulation results are analyzed.},

  abstract = {Two papers by Brian Kobilka and colleagues describe the X-ray crystal structure of the human {$\beta$}2 adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}2AR) bound to various agonists. {$\beta$}2AR is a member of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family of membrane-spanning receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate internal signalling pathways. With a ubiquitous role in human physiology, GPCRs are prime targets for drug discovery. A third paper by Christopher Tate and his team describes crystal structures of a similar GPCR, the turkey {$\beta$}1-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}1AR), bound to full and partial agonists. Together, these new structures reveal the subtle structural changes that accompany agonist binding, showing how binding events inside and outside the cell membrane stabilize the receptor's active state. Agonist binding to {$\beta$}1AR is shown to induce a contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist-bound receptor, and molecular-dynamics simulations of the {$\beta$}2AR agonist complex suggest that the agonist-bound active state spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like state in the absence of a G protein. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of the {$\beta$}1 adrenergic receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, bound to four small molecules that either act as full agonists or partial agonists is solved. The structures show that agonist binding induces a contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist-bound receptor. This work reveals the pharmacological differences between different ligand classes, which should facilitate the structure-based design of new drugs with predictable efficacies. {$\beta$}-adrenergic receptors ({$\beta$}ARs) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular G proteins upon binding catecholamine agonist ligands such as adrenaline and noradrenaline1,2. Synthetic ligands have been developed that either activate or inhibit {$\beta$}ARs for the treatment of asthma, hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. These ligands are classified as either full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, depending on whether the cellular response is similar to that of the native ligand, reduced or inhibited, respectively. However, the structural basis for these different ligand efficacies is unknown. Here we present four crystal structures of the thermostabilized turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) {$\beta$}1-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}1AR-m23) bound to the full agonists carmoterol and isoprenaline and the partial agonists salbutamol and dobutamine. In each case, agonist binding induces a 1 \AA{} contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist bound receptor. Full agonists can form hydrogen bonds with two conserved serine residues in transmembrane helix 5 (Ser5.42 and Ser5.46), but partial agonists only interact with Ser5.42 (superscripts refer to Ballesteros\textendash Weinstein numbering3). The structures provide an understanding of the pharmacological differences between different ligand classes, illuminating how GPCRs function and providing a solid foundation for the structure-based design of novel ligands with predictable efficacies.},

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) which addresses this drawback by providing tools to interpret DL models and their predictions. We review the principles of XAI in the domain of chemistry and emerging methods for creating and evaluating explanations. Then, we focus on methods developed by our group and their applications in predicting solubility, blood\textendash brain barrier permeability, and the scent of molecules. We show that XAI methods like chemical counterfactuals and descriptor explanations can explain DL predictions while giving insight into structure\textendash property relationships.

  abstract = {A methodology for semiempirical density functional optimization, using regularization and cross-validation methods from machine learning, is developed. We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF\textbackslash char21vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF\textbackslash char21vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF\textbackslash char21vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Applications of the approximation and its Bayesian ensemble error estimate to two intricate surface science problems support this.},

The 298 K heats of formation for ortho-, meta-, and para-benzyne derived in this manner are 106.6 {$\pm$} 3.0, 122.0 {$\pm$} 3.1, and 137.3 {$\pm$} 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The values for meta- and para-benzyne are higher than those reported previously (Wenthold, P. G.; Paulino, J. A.; Squires, R. R., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991,113, 7414) but are in excellent agreement with recently reported MCSCF and Cl calculations. Several control experiments are described which demonstrate that the earlier results for meta- and para-benzyne suffered from an acid-catalyzed isomerization of the reactant chlorophenyl anions in the flowing afterglow prior to CID threshold analysis. It is shown that CID threshold measurements with chlorophenyl-c/* anions are necessary in order to obtain the correct dissociation energies for the isomerically pure species. The gas-phase acidities of the meta and para positions of chlorobenzene were determined at 298 K using the silane cleavage method to be 391.1 {$\pm$} 2.0 and 393.9 {$\pm$} 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The heats of formation for the benzynes determined in this study are used to derive the gas-phase acidity of the 2-position of mefo-benzyne (365 {$\pm$} 3 kcal/mol) and the ortho, meta, and para C-H bond strengths in phenyl radical (79.9 {$\pm$}3.1,95.3 {$\pm$} 3.2, and 110.6 {$\pm$} 3.4 kcal/mol, respectively).

  abstract = {The isomeric m- and p-benzyne anions have been generated in the gas phase in a flowing afterglow-triple quadrupole instrument from the reactions of molecular fluorine (F2) with m- and p-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl anions. The mechanism of the F2 reaction involves electron transfer from the (trimethylsilyl)phenyl anion to F2, followed by nucleophilic attack on the resulting (trimethylsilyl)phenyl radical by the nascent F- formed within the intermediate ion/molecule complex. The structures of o-, m-, and p-benzyne anion are unambiguously identified by a classical derivatization scheme wherein the ions are first converted to the corresponding o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzoates by stepwise addition of CO2 and NO2. These derivatives are then identified by forming proton-bound dimers of each ion with CHF2CO2H, and comparing the O2NC6H4CO2-/CHF2CO2- yield ratios obtained by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with those obtained from analogous experiments with the authentic nitrobenzoate ions. Estimates of the electron affinities of m- and p-benzyne have been determined by the kinetic method. Adducts of SO2 with phenide ion and each of the isomeric benzyne anions are formed that produce measurable yields of SO2\textbullet - and the corresponding C6Hn- ion upon CID. A calibration relation is derived between the CID yield ratios obtained for the C6H5SO2- and o-C6H4SO2\textbullet - adducts and the known electron affinities of phenyl radical (25.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 kcal/mol) and o-benzyne (12.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 kcal/mol). The measured CID ratios for the m- and p-benzyne SO2 adducts are then combined with this relation to obtain EA(m-benzyne) = 19.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 kcal/mol and EA(p-benzyne) = 28.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 kcal/mol. These data are used to derive the following gas-phase acidities for the different ring positions of phenyl radical and the corresponding C-H bond strengths for the phenide ion ({$\Delta$}Hacid(C6H5), DH298[C6H4--H], kcal/mol):\, ortho 378.2 {$\pm$} 3.1, 93.7 {$\pm$} 3.1; meta 386.9 {$\pm$} 3.1, 102.4 {$\pm$} 3.1; para 393.5 {$\pm$} 2.9, 109.0 {$\pm$} 2.9.},

  abstract = {A formulation of numerical real space renormalization groups for quantum many-body problems is presented and several algorithms utilizing this formulation are outlined. The methods are presented and demonstrated using S = 1/2 and S = 1 Heisenberg chains as test cases. The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S = 1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10 The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties.},

The workshops have focused on developing lists of Core Principles or Foundational Concepts in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a list of foundational skills, and foundational concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics that all Biochemistry or Molecular Biology majors must understand to complete their major coursework. The allied fields working group created a survey to validate foundational concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics identified from participant feedback at various workshops. One-hundred twenty participants responded to the survey and 68\% of the respondents answered yes to the question: ``We have identified the following as the core concepts and underlying theories from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics that Biochemistry majors or Molecular Biology majors need to understand after they complete their major courses: 1) mechanical concepts from Physics, 2) energy and thermodynamic concepts from Physics, 3) critical concepts of structure from chemistry, 4) critical concepts of reactions from Chemistry, and 5) essential Mathematics. In your opinion, is the above list complete?'' Respondents also delineated subcategories they felt should be included in these broad categories. From the results of the survey and this analysis the allied fields working group constructed a consensus list of allied fields concepts, which will help inform Biochemistry and Molecular Biology educators when considering the ASBMB recommended curriculum for Biochemistry or Molecular Biology majors and in the development of appropriate assessment tools to gauge student understanding of how these concepts relate to biochemistry and molecular biology. \textcopyright{} 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 41(5):302\textendash 308, 2013},

Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule.

The exceptional dual bonding features, (i) the axial hydroxide readily reacts with carboxylic acid or alcohol and (ii) the Lewis acid Al center forms an adduct with a Lewis base such as pyridine or imidazole, make the AlPor a unique building block for the construction of `axial-bonding' type multicomponent donor\textendash acceptor systems for a variety of applications. Additionally, due to the rich redox chemistry and optical properties, the AlPor can act as either a photosensitizing electron acceptor or electron donor in donor\textendash acceptor systems. Unlike the zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnPor), the AlPor based donor\textendash acceptor provides an axial topology to investigate the sequential photoinduced energy transfer (EnT) and/or electron transfer (ET) processes in perpendicular to the porphyrin ring. This review surveys AlPor based multicomponent donor\textendash acceptor systems designed to mimic the various components of natural photosynthesis to develop an artificial photosynthetic system for tapping solar energy. Additionally, the review examines the photocatalytic behavior of AlPor towards solar fuel production. Finally, we will discuss the similarities and differences between the `axial-bonding' type AlPor and ZnPor systems.},

  abstract = {We revisit the formalism of the spin-adapted, spin-flip (SA-SF) configuration-interaction singles (CIS) method based on a tensor equation-of-motion formalism that affords proper spin eigenstates without sacrificing single-reference simplicity. Matrix elements for SA-SF-CIS are then modified in a manner similar to collinear spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT), to include a DFT exchange-correlation correction. The performance of this method, which we call SA-SF-DFT, is evaluated numerically and we find that it systematically improves the energies of electronic states that exhibit significant spin contamination within the conventional SF-TDDFT approach. The new method cures the state assignment problem that plagues geometry optimizations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using traditional SF-TDDFT, without sacrificing computational efficiency, and furthermore provides correct topology at conical intersections, including those that involve the ground state, unlike conventional TDDFT. As such, SA-SF-DFT appears to be a promising method for generating excited-state potential energy surfaces at DFT cost.}

  abstract = {We studied various gas molecules (NO2, O2, NH3, N2, CO2, CH4, H2O, H2, Ar) on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and bundles using first principles methods. The equilibrium position, adsorption energy, charge transfer, and electronic band structures are obtained for different kinds of SWNTs. Most molecules adsorb weakly on SWNTs and can be either charge donors or acceptors to the nanotubes. We find that the gas adsorption on the bundle interstitial and groove sites is stronger than that on individual nanotubes. The electronic properties of SWNTs are sensitive to the adsorption of certain gases such as NO2 and O2. Charge transfer and gas-induced charge fluctuation might significantly affect the transport properties of SWNTs. Our theoretical results are consistent with recent experiments.},
