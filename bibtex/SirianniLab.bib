  abstract = {An accurate force calculation with the Poisson\textendash Boltzmann equation is challenging, as it requires the electric field on the molecular surface. Here we present a calculation of the electric field on the solute\textendash solvent interface that is exact for piecewise linear variations of the potential and analyze four different alternatives to compute the force using a boundary element method. We performed a verification exercise for two cases: the isolated and two interacting molecules. Our results suggest that the boundary element method outperforms the finite difference method, as the latter needs a much finer mesh than in solvation energy calculations to get acceptable accuracy in the force, whereas the same surface mesh as in a standard energy calculation is appropriate for the boundary element method. Among the four evaluated alternatives of force calculation, we saw that the most accurate one is based on the Maxwell stress tensor. However, for a realistic application, like the barnase\textendash barstar complex, the approach based on variations of the energy functional, which is less accurate, gives equivalent results. This analysis is useful toward using the Poisson\textendash Boltzmann equation for force calculations in applications where high accuracy is key, for example, to feed molecular dynamics models or to enable the study of the interaction between large molecular structures, like viruses adsorbed onto substrates.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of temperature-dependent reaction rate constants of organic compounds is of great importance to both atmospheric chemistry and combustion science. Extensive work has been done on developing automated mechanism generation systems but the lack of quality reaction rate data remains a huge bottleneck in the application of highly detailed mechanisms. Machine learning prediction models have been recently adopted to alleviate the data gap in thermochemistry and have great potential to do the same for kinetic data with the recent release of quality reaction rate data compilations. The ultimate goal is to formulate easily accessible, general-purpose, temperature-dependent, and multitarget models for the prediction of reaction rates. To that end, we propose a model that depends on the well-known Morgan fingerprints as well as learned representations transferred from the QM9 data set. We propose the use of an Arrhenius-based loss where predictions of the three modified-Arrhenius parameters (A, n, and B = Ea/R) are given instead of the direct prediction of reaction rate constants. Our model is {$>$}35\% more accurate compared to a baseline model of feed forward network (FFN) on Morgan fingerprints.},

This method is based on atomistic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the ReaxFF reactive force field. Results reported in this study are for supercritical (P = 55 MPa and Tu = 1800 K) combustion of hydrocarbons as elevated pressure and temperature are required to accelerate the dynamics for reactive MD simulations. These simulations are performed for different types of hydrocarbons, including alkyne, alkane, and aromatic, and are able to successfully reproduce the experimental trend of reactivity of these hydrocarbons. Moreover, our results indicate that the ignition front propagation speed under supercritical conditions has a strong dependence on equivalence ratio, similar to experimentally measured flame speeds at lower temperatures and pressures which supports our hypothesis that ignition front speed is a related quantity to laminar flame speed. In addition, comparisons between results obtained from ReaxFF simulation and continuum simulations performed under similar conditions show good qualitative, and reasonable quantitative agreement. This demonstrates that ReaxFF based MD-simulations are a promising tool to study flame speed/ignition front speed in supercritical hydrocarbon combustion.},

  abstract = {One of the first significant developments in wildfire modeling research was to introduce heat flux as wildfire line intensity (kW{$\cdot$}m\textendash 1). This idea could be adapted to using weather station measurements, topography, and fuel properties to estimate rate of fire spread, shape, and intensity. This review will present, in an accessible manner, the next evolution in wildfire models. The new generation models use mechanistic combustion models and large-eddy simulation (LES) to define the flaming combustion and the mechanism of rate of spread. These wildfire models are then coupled to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or mesoscale weather model. In other words, wildfire models become weather and climate models with add-in fuel and terrain models. These coupled models can use existing fire and weather physics or developed noncoupled models with a coupling mechanism. These models are tailored for specific spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract = {The gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds is an important chemical process in the Earth's atmosphere. It governs oxidant levels and controls the production of key secondary pollutants, and hence has major implications for air quality and climate. Organic oxidation is largely controlled by the chemistry of a few reactive intermediates, namely, alkyl (R) radicals, alkoxy (RO) radicals, peroxy (RO2) radicals, and carbonyl oxides (R1R2COO), which may undergo a number of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Our understanding of these intermediates, and the reaction pathways available to them, is based largely on studies of unfunctionalized intermediates, formed in the first steps of hydrocarbon oxidation. However, it has become increasingly clear that intermediates with functional groups, which are generally formed later in the oxidation process, can exhibit fundamentally different reactivity than unfunctionalized ones. In this Perspective, we explore the unique chemistry available to functionalized organic intermediates in the Earth's atmosphere. After a brief review of the canonical chemistry available to unfunctionalized intermediates, we discuss how the addition of functional groups can introduce new reactions, either by changing the energetics or kinetics of a given reaction or by opening up new chemical pathways. We then provide examples of atmospheric reaction classes that are available only to functionalized intermediates. Some of these, such as unimolecular H-shift reactions of RO2 radicals, have been elucidated only relatively recently, and can have important impacts on atmospheric chemistry (e.g., on radical cycling or organic aerosol formation); it seems likely that other, as-yet undiscovered reactions of (multi)functional intermediates may also exist. We discuss the challenges associated with the study of the chemistry of such intermediates and review novel experimental and theoretical approaches that have recently provided (or hold promise for providing) new insights into their atmospheric chemistry.

Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 4913-4928]) has been extended to the employment of explicitly correlated (F12) methods. A thorough benchmark based on a wide range of prototypical reactions shows that the new model (referred to as junChS-F12), which employs cost-effective revDSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ) reference geometries, has an improved performance with respect to its conventional counterpart and outperforms the most well-known model chemistries without the need of any empirical parameter and at an affordable computational cost. Several benchmarks show that revDSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ) structures and force fields provide zero point energies and thermal contributions, which can be confidently used, together with junChS-F12 electronic energies, for obtaining accurate reaction rates in the framework of the master equation approach based on the ab initio transition-state theory.}

  abstract = {Global potentials for the physisorption of rare- gas atoms on graphene and graphite, amenable for a variety of dynamics simulations, are reported. An atom\textbackslash textminusbond pairwise additive form of the potential is used, where the interaction pairs, represented by proper analytical functions, are constituted by the Rg atom (Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr) and the C\textbackslash textminusC bonds of the graphene sheet(s). The parameters of the atom\textbackslash textminusbond pair potential, derived from the polarizability of the interacting partners, are fine-tuned, exploiting calculations of the prototypical Rg\textbackslash textminuscoronene system using high-level electronic structure methods and large basis sets. The atom\textbackslash textminusgraphene/graphite potential is further expanded in a Fourier series, and it is found that for an accurate representation of the interaction only a small number of corrugation terms need to be added to the laterally averaged potential. Furthermore, this corrugation part of the potential is both identical for Rg\textbackslash textminusgraphene and Rg\textbackslash textminus graphite; in other words, inner layers of graphite only play a role in the laterally averaged Rg\textbackslash textminusgraphite potential. For all systems, the hollow at the center of the carbon ring is the preferred adsorption site, although diffusion barriers are low. The present results compare well with previous data regarding well depths and equilibrium distances at different adsorption sites and, for graphite, the long-range dispersion coefficient C3. In addition, binding energies (eigenvalues of the laterally averaged potentials) are in a fairly good agreement with experimental determinations, providing further support for the reliability of the potentials.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared (12,500\textendash 4,000 cm-1; 800\textendash 2,500 nm) spectroscopy is the hallmark for one of the most rapidly advancing analytical techniques over the last few decades. Although it is mainly recognized as an analytical tool, near-infrared spectroscopy has also contributed significantly to physical chemistry, e.g., by delivering invaluable data on the anharmonic nature of molecular vibrations or peculiarities of intermolecular interactions. In all these contexts, a major barrier in the form of an intrinsic complexity of near-infrared spectra has been encountered. A large number of overlapping vibrational contributions influenced by anharmonic effects create complex patterns of spectral dependencies, in many cases hindering our comprehension of near-infrared spectra. Quantum mechanical calculations commonly serve as a major support to infrared and Raman studies; conversely, near-infrared spectroscopy has long been hindered in this regard due to practical limitations. Advances in anharmonic theories in hyphenation with ever-growing computer technology have enabled feasible theoretical near-infrared spectroscopy in recent times. Accordingly, a growing number of quantum mechanical investigations aimed at near-infrared region has been witnessed. The present review article summarizes these most recent accomplishments in the emerging field. Applications of generalized approaches, such as vibrational self-consistent field and vibrational second order perturbation theories as well as their derivatives, and dense grid-based studies of vibrational potential, are overviewed. Basic and applied studies are discussed, with special attention paid to the ones which aim at improving analytical spectroscopy. A remarkable potential arises from the growing applicability of anharmonic computations to solving the problems which arise in both basic and analytical near-infrared spectroscopy. This review highlights an increased value of quantum mechanical calculations to near-infrared spectroscopy in relation to other kinds of vibrational spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Since their introduction about 25 years ago, machine learning (ML) potentials have become an important tool in the field of atomistic simulations. After the initial decade, in which neural networks were successfully used to construct potentials for rather small molecular systems, the development of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) in 2007 opened the way for the application of ML potentials in simulations of large systems containing thousands of atoms. To date, many other types of ML potentials have been proposed continuously increasing the range of problems that can be studied. In this review, the methodology of the family of HDNNPs including new recent developments will be discussed using a classification scheme into four generations of potentials, which is also applicable to many other types of ML potentials. The first generation is formed by early neural network potentials designed for low-dimensional systems. High-dimensional neural network potentials established the second generation and are based on three key steps: first, the expression of the total energy as a sum of environment-dependent atomic energy contributions; second, the description of the atomic environments by atom-centered symmetry functions as descriptors fulfilling the requirements of rotational, translational, and permutation invariance; and third, the iterative construction of the reference electronic structure data sets by active learning. In third-generation HDNNPs, in addition, long-range interactions are included employing environment-dependent partial charges expressed by atomic neural networks. In fourth-generation HDNNPs, which are just emerging, in addition, nonlocal phenomena such as long-range charge transfer can be included. The applicability and remaining limitations of HDNNPs are discussed along with an outlook at possible future developments.},

  abstract = {In this work, laser induced fluorescence (LIF) has been applied to probe PAHs in two atmospheric sooting flames: a premixed flat flame of methane and a Diesel turbulent spray one. Different laser excitation wavelengths have been used. UV excitations at 266 and 355nm have been operated from the fourth and the third harmonic frequencies of an Nd: YAG laser while visible excitations were emitted by an OPO pumped by the third harmonic of the YAG laser. Because of the different nature of the flames, the recorded fluorescence spectra highlight different spectral properties. The diffusion flame appears to provide a better selectivity to the LIF measurements because of the stratification of the PAHs size classes along the flame height. In the premixed flame, all PAHs size classes spatially coexist making the analysis of LIF measurements more complex. Upon visible excitations, it is highlighted in this paper that PAHs can absorb and fluoresce up to 680nm. Fluorescence emission spectra are shown to present Stokes and anti-Stokes components. Discussion of these non-conventional absorption and fluorescence features are provided on the basis of the knowledge of PAH spectroscopy and flame kinetics. Hence, different families of PAHs are successively envisaged and discussed to elucidate the experimental spectra recorded in both flames. It is shown that only a limited number of PAHs are able to lead to such spectral features. From this discussion, it appears that large pericondensed PAHs are unlikely to give rise to such signals. Some other possibilities are therefore discussed which could potentially correspond to the latest fluorescent gaseous species at the origin of the soot formation.},

The performance of different functionals is evaluated by extensive benchmark calculations of energy gaps in a variety of diradicals and open-shell atoms. The benchmark set consists of 41 energy gaps. A consistently good performance is observed for the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) family, in particular PBE0 and PBE50, which yield mean average deviations of 0.126 and 0.090 eV, respectively. In most cases, the performance of original (collinear) SF-TDDFT with 50-50 functional is also satisfactory (as compared to non-collinear variants), except for the same-center diradicals where both collinear and non-collinear SF variants that use LYP or B97 exhibit large errors. The accuracy of NC-SF-TDDFT and collinear SF-TDDFT with 50-50 and BHHLYP is very similar. Using PBE50 within collinear formalism does not improve the accuracy.},

However, its application to complex molecular systems, including those relevant to electrochemical reactivity and decomposition, has been limited by insufficient automation.Here, we report a broadly applicable, automated framework for the accurate and robust DFT calculation of molecules, capable of addressing species relevant to electrochemistry. This framework is specifically designed to study molecules with different charge states, open-shell electronic structure, metal coordination, and implicit solvation. We first identify appropriate levels of theory that avoid calculation failures and accurately predict molecular redox potentials. We then describe our framework, including methods to automatically detect and correct errors and to optimize structures from saddle points to potential energy surface minima. To demonstrate the efficacy of this framework, we examine a case study including over 12,000 calculations of reactive molecular fragments. This framework is able to reduce the rate of failure for DFT calculations from 25.1\% to 1.2\%, significantly improving the degree of automation possible for high-throughput molecular DFT.},

  abstract = {The many-body expansion (MBE) is promising for the efficient, parallel computation of lattice energies in organic crystals. Very high accuracy should be achievable by employing coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples at the complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS] for the dimers, trimers, and potentially tetramers resulting from the MBE, but such a brute-force approach seems impractical for crystals of all but the smallest molecules. Here, we investigate hybrid or multi-level approaches that employ CCSD(T)/CBS only for the closest dimers and trimers and utilize much faster methods like M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for more distant dimers and trimers. For trimers, MP2 is supplemented with the Axilrod\textendash Teller\textendash Muto (ATM) model of three-body dispersion. MP2(+ATM) is shown to be a very effective replacement for CCSD(T)/CBS for all but the closest dimers and trimers. A limited investigation of tetramers using CCSD(T)/CBS suggests that the four-body contribution is entirely negligible. The large set of CCSD(T)/CBS dimer and trimer data should be valuable in benchmarking approximate methods for molecular crystals and allows us to see that a literature estimate of the core-valence contribution of the closest dimers to the lattice energy using just MP2 was overbinding by 0.5 kJ mol-1, and an estimate of the three-body contribution from the closest trimers using the T0 approximation in local CCSD(T) was underbinding by 0.7 kJ mol-1. Our CCSD(T)/CBS best estimate of the 0 K lattice energy is -54.01 kJ mol-1, compared to an estimated experimental value of -55.3 {$\pm$} 2.2 kJ mol-1.},

  abstract = {An Ising-type model for spin conversion, explicitly accounting for intramolecular vibrations has been studied. Each two level system is associated with p harmonic oscillators having two possible frequencies w\_LS, w\_HS. The major advantage of this model is that it provides an excellent agreement with both the conversion curve and calorimetric data, in particular the entropy change upon spin conversion. With the help of Arrhenius plots, the predictions of the model are accurately compared to the literature experimental data on the spin equilibrium curves. A very accurate M\"ossbauer investigation by Jacobi, Spiering and G\"utlich, provides evidence for a small effect typical for vibrations. A novel example is given where the conversion curve is essentially monitored by vibrations; this originates from the extremely small value of the energy gap between HS and LS electrovibrational groundstates. However, in most cases, as a first approach, the low freqeuncy approximation of the model can be used. Then the model reduces to a simple two-level model with additional degeneracies implicitely accounting for intramolecular vibrations.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method for the computation of well-defined optimized atomic partial charges and radii from the total electron density. Our method is based on a two-step radical Voronoi tessellation of the (possibly periodic) system and subsequent integration of the total electron density within each Voronoi cell. First, the total electron density is partitioned into the contributions of each molecule, and subsequently the electron density within each molecule is assigned to the individual atoms using a second set of atomic radii for the radical Voronoi tessellation. The radii are optimized on-the-fly to minimize the fluctuation (variance) of molecular and atomic charges. Therefore, our method is completely free of empirical parameters. As a by-product, two sets of optimized atomic radii are produced in each run, which take into account many specific properties of the system investigated. The application of an on-the-fly interpolation scheme reduces discretization noise in the Voronoi integration. The approach is particularly well suited for the calculation of partial charges in periodic bulk phase systems. We apply the method to five exemplary liquid phase simulations and show how the optimized charges can help to understand the interactions in the systems. Well-known effects such as reduced ion charges below unity in ionic liquid systems are correctly predicted without any tuning, empiricism, or rescaling. We show that the basis set dependence of our method is very small. Only the total electron density is evaluated, and thus, the approach can be combined with any electronic structure method that provides volumetric total electron densities\textemdash it is not limited to Hartree\textendash Fock or density functional theory (DFT). We have implemented the method into our open-source software tool TRAVIS.},

Vibrational spectra of the mass-selected ions tagged with Ne were recorded using infrared predissociation spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion trap instrument using the intense and widely tunable radiation of a free electron laser. Comparison of high-level quantum chemical calculations and resonant depletion measurements revealed that the C3H+ ion is exclusively formed in its most stable linear isomeric form, whereas two isomers were observed for C3H2+. Bands of the energetically favored cyclic c-C3H2+ are in excellent agreement with calculated anharmonic frequencies, whereas for the linear open-shell HCCCH+ (2{$\Pi$}g) a detailed theoretical description of the spectrum remains challenging because of Renner\textendash Teller and spin\textendash orbit interactions. Good agreement between theory and experiment, however, is observed for the frequencies of the stretching modes for which an anharmonic treatment was possible. In the case of linear l-C3H+, small but non-negligible effects of the attached Ne on the ion fundamental band positions and the overall spectrum were found.},

  abstract = {The density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) method has seen a rise in adoption for materials modeling, as it offers significant improvement in scalability with accuracy comparable to the density functional theory (DFT) when good parameterizations exist. The cost reduction in DFTB compared to DFT is achieved by the pre-parameterization of the elements of the Hamiltonian matrix as well as the repulsion potential between all pairs of atoms. Parameterization for new systems with accuracies competitive with DFT in specific applications requires specialized manpower and computational resources. This prevents the application of the DFTB method to systems for which it was not parameterized. In this work, we explore an approach to address the problem of missing parameters of DFTB by modeling the interactions with missing Slater\textendash Koster parameters with an interatomic interaction potential. When the distance between two atoms modeled at the force-field level is sufficiently large, the approach results in accurate structural and electronic properties. The resulting calculation is therefore a hybrid between DFTB and molecular mechanics, a pure DFTB for atoms with a complete set of interatomic parameterizations, and a mix between DFTB and molecular mechanics for atoms with a missing interatomic parameterization. The approach is expected to be particularly useful for hybrid materials and interfaces. The method is tested on the examples of 2D materials, mixed oxides, and a large-scale calculation of an oxide\textendash oxide interface.},

Monte Carlo simulations with statistical perturbation theory yielded relative free energies of hydration. These were converted to absolute quantities through perturbations to reference molecules for which absolute free energies of hydration had been obtained previously in TIP4P water. The average errors in the computed absolute free energies of hydration are 1.1 kcal/mol for the 6-31G* EPS charges and 4.0 kcal/mol for the Mulliken charges. For the EPS charges, the largest individual errors are under 2 kcal/mol except for acetamide, in which case the error is 3.7 kcal/mol.

The extension, abbreviated as SF-XCIS, includes all configurations in which no more than one virtual level of the high spin triplet reference becomes occupied and no more than one doubly occupied level becomes vacant. The number of such configurations is quadratic with molecule size, and the method is implemented in a direct algorithm whose cost scales in the same way with molecule size as CIS itself, thus permitting applications to large systems. Starting from a spin restricted triplet determinant, SF-XCIS yields spin-pure singlet, triplet, and quintet states, and treats both half-occupied reference orbitals in a fully balanced way to allow application to strongly correlated problems. Tests on bond dissociation in the HF molecule, the torsional potential of ethylene, and excited states of polyenes show encouraging improvements using SF-XCIS compared to SF-CIS and a previously suggested extension, the spin-complete CIS model.}

Only considering its stoichiometry, the reaction network is decomposed into self-sustaining sub-networks called organizations. These are arranged into an overlapping hierarchy representing the organizational structure of the reaction network. We analyze both the day- and nightside of Mars, discovering a simple, combinatorial hierarchy of organizations for the nightside and a rich and complex hierarchy for the dayside. One organization representing the recycling pathway for CO2 could be identified. Molecular species of similar molecular structure are found to often appear together in organizations. For the dayside, only few organizations contain many molecular species, indicating that only few steady states featuring a high diversity in molecular composition exist. Using a simulated concentration profile, organizations can be grouped into four categories with distinct intensity profiles.},

Even at this early stage, it has enabled the solution of many problems that would previously have been intractable with any other method, in particular, multireference problems with very large active spaces. Historically, the DMRG was not originally formulated from a wavefunction perspective, but rather in a Renormalisation Group (RG) language. However, it is now realised that a wavefunction view of the DMRG provides a more convenient, and in some cases more powerful, paradigm. Here we provide an expository introduction to the DMRG ansatz in the context of quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we have examined the performance of the various small basis sets and their geometric counterpoise (gCP) corrections for DFT computations. The original gCP correction scheme includes four adjustable parameters tailored for each method and basis set, but we find that the use of a single scaling parameter also yields fair results. We term this simplified scheme unity-gCP, which can be straightforwardly applied for devising a reasonable correction for an arbitrary basis set. With the use of unity-gCP, we have examined a systematic set of medium-sized basis sets, and we find 6-31+G(2d) to be the optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. On the other hand, less balanced basis sets, even larger ones, can show significantly worse accuracy; the inclusion of gCP may even lead to severe overcorrections. Thus, sufficient validations would be imperative before the general application of gCP for a particular basis set. For 6-31+G(2d), a welcoming finding is that its gCP has small magnitudes, and thus, it also yields adequate results without gCP corrections. This observation echoes that for the {$\omega$}B97X-3c method, which uses an optimized double-{$\zeta$} basis set (vDZP) without the inclusion of gCP. In an attempt to improve vDZP by mimicking the somewhat better-performing 6-31+G(2d), we partially decontract the outer functions of vDZP. The resulting basis set, which we termed vDZ+(2d), generally yields improved results. Overall, the vDZP and the new vDZ+(2d) basis sets pave a way for obtaining reasonable results more efficiently for a wide range of systems than the practice of using a triple- or quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis set in DFT calculations.},

  abstract = {Compared with fluorinated cycloalkanes and liner olefins, the degradation of chlorofluorocycloolefins is much easier with good environmental friendliness. However, the fire-extinguishing performance of chlorofluorocycloolefins has been rarely explored. In this study, the fire-extinguishing performance and working mechanism of octafluorocyclopentene (C5F8) and 1-chloro-2,3,3,4,4,5,5-heptafluorocyclopentene (C5F7Cl) were studied by combined experimental and theoretical approach. It was found that, compared to C5F8, the asymmetry of C5F7Cl agent with the chlorine atom possesses a reduced energy barrier in pyrolysis process and its reaction with OH{$\cdot$} radicals. Moreover, chlorine-containing unsaturated active groups and CF2{$\cdot$} radicals generated in C5F7Cl pyrolysis can effectively capture flame radicals. As a result, a relatively low minimum extinguishing concentrations (MECs) for suppressing methane-air (5.37 vol\%) and propane-air flame (5.93 vol\%) is achieved outperforms that of C5F8 (6.73 and 7.74 vol\%), even better than reported fluorinated cycloalkanes and chlorofluoroolefins agents. This study shows that chlorofluorocycloolefins are promising Halon substitutes over perfluorocyclic olefins in fire-extinguishing performance.},

We also observe that during biomass combustion, the formation of CO is facilitated at higher temperatures, whereas CO2 production is favored at lower temperatures. More rapid decomposition and oxidation of biomass during combustion occur under fuel-lean conditions compared to fuel-rich conditions. Finally, more H2O and fewer H2 molecules are generated during the combustion process under the O2/CO2 atmosphere when increasing the concentration of CO2.

To bridge the knowledge gap, this article proposes a methodology applying molecular dynamics (MD) simulation as a tool to characterise the thermal degradation process of polymer composites, especially the emission of volatile and toxic gas species. The method was applied to three common engineering polymers: i) high-density polyethene (HDPE), ii) polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and iii) high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). Based on the modelling results, the chemical distribution of the fully-decomposed chemical compounds was realised for the selected polymers. The chemical composition and charring kinetics were validated against thermogravimetry data via experimental measurement. Numerical simulations demonstrated good agreement with the thermogravimetric analysis experiments. It was found that all HDPE, PMMA, and HIPS formed fuel gas with alkane group (i.e. mainly C1-C3) that acted as the combustible source. Furthermore, the composition of char formations for the selective polymers can be predicted by the MD simulation through analysing the accumulation of pure carbon chain compounds. In this study, MD simulation identified the detailed decomposition process from solid to gas phases, which could further act as the precursors of combustible fuel gases in combustion models, and significantly enhance the reliability of toxic gas, charring, and smoke particulate predictions.},

  abstract = {Development of aviation and aerospace fuels requires deep insight into the pyrolysis and combustion mechanisms. However, rapid and complex reactions during fuel combustion make it difficult to accurately describe the free radicals, reaction paths and other relevant details in large-scale reaction systems through experiments or quantum mechanics. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based on reaction force-fields (ReaxFF) is an effective method to solve the above problems, which can reveal the overall reaction mechanism in the fuel combustion process by dynamically describing the breakage and formation of bonds. Here in, the recent progress of ReaxFF MD in exploring the pyrolysis and combustion mechanism of aviation fuels, aerospace fuels and energetic additives is summarized, especially for aviation kerosene model substitutes, high-density aviation fuels, aerospace fuels and energetic additives under various conditions. Finally, the shortcomings of ReaxFF MD simulation in describing fuel pyrolysis or combustion systems are discussed, and the application prospect of ReaxFF MD simulation in the fuel field is prospected.},

To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O2 systems. From simulations on methane/O2, o-xylene/O2, propene/O2, and benzene/O2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene {$>$} o-xylene {$>$} methane {$>$} benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.},

By heating a Rosmarinus officinalis plant in a specific hermetic enclosure, a mixture of 14 biogenic volatile organic compounds is identified and their mass fractions determined as temperature functions. The theoretical flammability limits of those components are calculated by means of empirical correlations. Froude-scaling law is applied to laboratory emission results to find the concentrations of biogenic volatile organic compounds at field scale. The comparison of the flammability limits with the calculated concentrations at real scale using this changing-scale analysis shows that the emitted biogenic volatile organic compounds can lead to an accelerating forest fire.},

  abstract = {The EON software is designed for simulations of the state-to-state evolution of atomic scale systems over timescales greatly exceeding that of direct classical dynamics. States are defined as collections of atomic configurations from which a minimization of the potential energy gives the same inherent structure. The time evolution is assumed to be governed by rare events, where transitions between states are uncorrelated and infrequent compared with the timescale of atomic vibrations. Several methods for calculating the state-to-state evolution have been implemented in EON, including parallel replica dynamics, hyperdynamics and adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo. Global optimization methods, including simulated annealing, basin hopping and minima hopping are also implemented. The software has a client/server architecture where the computationally intensive evaluations of the interatomic interactions are calculated on the client-side and the state-to-state evolution is managed by the server. The client supports optimization for different computer architectures to maximize computational efficiency. The server is written in Python so that developers have access to the high-level functionality without delving into the computationally intensive components. Communication between the server and clients is abstracted so that calculations can be deployed on a single machine, clusters using a queuing system, large parallel computers using a message passing interface, or within a distributed computing environment. A generic interface to the evaluation of the interatomic interactions is defined so that empirical potentials, such as in LAMMPS, and density functional theory as implemented in VASP and GPAW can be used interchangeably. Examples are given to demonstrate the range of systems that can be modeled, including surface diffusion and island ripening of adsorbed atoms on metal surfaces, molecular diffusion on the surface of ice and global structural optimization of nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Atomic partial charges are among the most commonly used interpretive tools in quantum chemistry. Dozens of different `population analyses' are in use, which are best seen as proxies (indirect gauges) rather than measurements of a `general ionicity'. For the GMTKN55 benchmark of nearly 2,500 main-group molecules, which span a broad swathe of chemical space, some two dozen different charge distributions were evaluated at the PBE0 level near the 1-particle basis set limit. The correlation matrix between the different charge distributions exhibits a block structure; blocking is, broadly speaking, by charge distribution class. A principal component analysis on the entire dataset suggests that nearly all variation can be accounted for by just two `principal components of ionicity': one has all the distributions going in sync, while the second corresponds mainly to Bader QTAIM vs. all others. A weaker third component corresponds to electrostatic charge models in opposition to the orbital-based ones. The single charge distributions that have the greatest statistical similarity to the first principal component are iterated Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-I) and a minimal-basis projected modification of Bickelhaupt charges. If three individual variables, rather than three principal components, are to be identified that contain most of the information in the whole dataset, one representative for each of the three classes of Corminboeuf et al. is needed: one based on partitioning of the density (such as QTAIM), a second based on orbital partitioning (such as NPA), and a third based on the molecular electrostatic potential (such as HLY or CHELPG).},

With the current shift to more complex deep learning models, in many situations that utility is lost. In this work, we expand on our previously work on computational thermochemistry and propose an interpretable graph network, FragGraph(nodes), that provides decomposed predictions into fragment-wise contributions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model in predicting a correction to density functional theory (DFT)-calculated atomization energies using {$\Delta$}-learning. Our model predicts G4(MP2)-quality thermochemistry with an accuracy of {$<$}1 kJ mol-1 for the GDB9 dataset. Besides the high accuracy of our predictions, we observe trends in the fragment corrections which quantitatively describe the deficiencies of B3LYP. Node-wise predictions significantly outperform our previous model predictions from a global state vector. This effect is most pronounced as we explore the generality by predicting on more diverse test sets indicating node-wise predictions are less sensitive to extending machine learning models to larger molecules.},

  abstract = {We apply a new restrained electrostatic potential fit charge model (two-stage RESP) to conformational analysis and the calculation of intermolecular interactions. Specifically, we study conformational energies in butane, methyl ethyl thioether, three simple alcohols, three simple amines, and 1,2-ethanediol as a function of charge model (two-stage RESP vs standard ESP) and 1-4 electrostatic scale factor. We demonstrate that the two-stage RESP model with a 1-4 electrostatic scale factor of \textemdash 1/1.2 is a very good model, as evaluated by comparison with high-level ab initio calculations. For methanol and /V-methylacetamide interactions with TIP3P water, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds only slightly weaker than found with the standard ESP changes. In tests on DNA base pairs, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds which are \textasciitilde{} 1 kcal/mol weaker than those calculated with the standard ESP charges but closer in magnitude to the best current available ab initio calculations. Furthermore, the two-stage RESP charges, unlike the standard ESP charges, reproduce the result that Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding is stronger than Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding for adenine-thymine base pairs. The free energies of solvation of both methanol and f/ww-iV-methylacetamide were also calculated for the standard ESP and two-stage RESP models and both were in good agreement with experiment. We have combined the use of two-stage RESP charges with multiple conformational fitting\textemdash recently employed using standard ESP charges as described by Reynolds, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 9075)\textemdash in studies of conformationally dependent dipole moments and energies of propylamine. We find that the combination of these approaches is synergistic in leading to useful charge distributions for molecular simulations. Two-stage RESP charges thus reproduce both intermolecular and intramolecular energies and structures quite well, making this charge model a critical advancement in the development of a general force field for modeling biological macromolecules and their ligands, both in the gas phase and in solution.},

Contrary to long-lived species such as greenhouse gases, interference-free accurate and precise concentration assessments of strongly reactive short-lived species represent a real challenge. In this paper, we report on the recent progress in spectroscopic instrumental developments for monitoring of OH, NO3, HONO and NO2 by using modern photonic sources (Quantum Cascade Laser, distributed feedback diode laser, light emitting diode) in conjunction with high-sensitivity spectroscopic measurement techniques such as multi-pass cell based long optical path length absorption spectroscopy, wavelength-modulation enhanced off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy, Faraday rotation spectroscopy, incoherent broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy. The main techniques available for routine atmospheric measurements of OH, NO3 and HONO are overviewed, in comparison with the emerging modern photonic spectroscopy techniques.},

  abstract = {We initiate a series of works where we study the interior of dynamical rotating vacuum black holes without symmetry. In the present paper, we take up the problem starting from appropriate Cauchy data for the Einstein vacuum equations defined on a hypersurface already within the black hole interior, representing the expected geometry just inside the event horizon. We prove that for all such data, the maximal Cauchy evolution can be extended across a non-trivial piece of Cauchy horizon as a Lorentzian manifold with continuous metric. In subsequent work, we will retrieve our assumptions on data assuming only that the black hole event horizon geometry suitably asymptotes to a rotating Kerr solution. In particular, if the exterior region of the Kerr family is proven to be dynamically stable\textemdash as is widely expected\textemdash then it will follow that the C0-inextendibility formulation of Penrose's celebrated strong cosmic censorship conjecture is in fact false. The proof suggests, however, that the C0-metric Cauchy horizons thus arising are generically singular in an essential way, representing so-called ``weak null singularities'', and thus that a revised version of strong cosmic censorship holds.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the 2020 release of the GEISA database (Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques Atmosph\'eriques: Management and Study of Atmospheric Spectroscopic Information), developed and maintained at LMD since 1974. GEISA is the reference database for several current or planned Thermal and Short-Wave InfraRed (TIR and SWIR) space missions IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer), IASI-NG (IASI New Generation), MicroCarb (Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission), Merlin (MEthane Remote sensing LIdar missioN). It is actually a compilation of three databases: the ``line parameters database'', the ``cross-section sub-database'' and the ``microphysical and optical properties of atmospheric aerosols sub-database''. The new edition concerns only the line parameters dataset, with significant updates and additions implemented using the best available spectroscopic data. The GEISA-2020 line parameters database involves 58 molecules (145 isotopic species) and contains 6,746,987 entries, in the spectral range from 10-6 to 35877 cm-1. In this version, 23 molecules have been updated (with 10 new isotopic species) and 6 new molecules have been added (HONO, COFCl, CH3F, CH3I, RuO4, H2C3H2 (isomer of C3H4)) corresponding to 15 isotopic species. The compilation can be accessed through the AERIS data and services center for the atmosphere website (https://geisa.aeris-data.fr/), with the development of a powerful graphical tool and convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data using modern technologies (PostgreSQL database, REST API, VueJS, Plotly). Based on four examples (H2O, O3, O2 and SF6), this paper also shows how the LMD in house validation algorithm SPARTE (Spectroscopic Parameters And Radiative Transfer Evaluation) helps to evaluate, correct, reject or defer the input of new spectroscopic data into GEISA and this, thanks to iterations with researchers from different communities (spectroscopy, radiative transfer).},

Novel methods that make hypotheses for elementary steps and complementary means for reaction path and transition state (TS) optimization are lowering the amount of chemical intuition and user effort required to explore reaction networks. The resulting networks lead from reactants to reactive intermediates and products, and are becoming closer representations of physical mechanisms involved in experiments. This review describes several of these approaches, which are categorized based on their overarching TS finding strategies. Future advances are discussed that may revolutionize the ability of simulation to fully predict not just the reaction mechanism but reaction outcomes.

Collision-induced dissociation breakdown curves of the formate\textendash water complexes were obtained as a function of collision energy and modeled to extract relative activation energies for the observed channels. Density functional theory calculations (B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)) of the water loss reactions were consistent with reactions having no reverse energy barrier in each case. Overall, the results indicate that the interaction of formates with atmospheric water can form stable encounter complexes that will dissociate by sequential water loss to form protonated formates.},

  abstract = {Given a chemical reaction going from reactant (R) to the product (P) on a potential energy surface (PES) and a collective variable (CV) discriminating between R and P, we define the free-energy profile (FEP) as the logarithm of the marginal Boltzmann distribution of the CV. This FEP is not a true free energy. Nevertheless, it is common to treat the FEP as the ``free-energy'' analog of the minimum potential energy path and to take the activation free energy, {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P, as the difference between the maximum at the transition state and the minimum at R. We show that this approximation can result in large errors. The FEP depends on the CV and is, therefore, not unique. For the same reaction, different discriminating CVs can yield different {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P. We derive an exact expression for the activation free energy that avoids this ambiguity. We find {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P to be a combination of the probability of the system being in the reactant state, the probability density on the dividing surface, and the thermal de Broglie wavelength associated with the transition. We apply our formalism to simple analytic models and realistic chemical systems and show that the FEP-based approximation applies only at low temperatures for CVs with a small effective mass. Most chemical reactions occur on complex, high-dimensional PES that cannot be treated analytically and pose the added challenge of choosing a good CV. We study the influence of that choice and find that, while the reaction free energy is largely unaffected, {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P is quite sensitive.},

  abstract = {Toluene is an important constituent of liquid fuel, and it contributes to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) under photochemical conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of toluene SOAs is not fully understood. To address this issue, an atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) approach and density functional theory (DFT) are coupled to study the molecular chemistry of toluene SOAs by examining their structural characteristics and thermodynamic properties. Both MD and DFT methods are proven to be consistent with experimental results. Our results suggest that the molecular hierarchical synergistic effects majorly determine the formation of core\textendash shell SOA nanoparticles. In the toluene photooxidation production, pyruvic acid acts as a ``bridge'' that promotes concentration of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid at the surface of H2SO4\textendash H2O clusters. Besides, the chemical composition and environmental temperature have a key role in the probability distribution and lifetime of hydrogen bonds of toluene SOAs, thus altering the formation energy barrier of gas-to-nanoparticle conversion. When compared with van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions are found to be the central driving force that yields stable toluene SOA nanoparticles. Our results reveal the molecular chemistry for the atmospheric aerosol and highlight the need to account for molecular hierarchical synergistic effects when assessing the atmospheric aerosol.},

  abstract = {A common need in machine vision is to compute the 3-D rigid body transformation that aligns two sets of points for which correspondence is known. A comparative analysis is presented here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which computes the translational and rotational components of the transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the transformation representation used and the mathematical derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard [R,T] representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform. This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to degenerate data sets, and (3) relative computation time of each approach under different conditions. The results indicate that under ``ideal'' data conditions (no noise) certain distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for ``typical, real-world'' noise levels, there is no difference in the robustness of the final solutions (contrary to certain previously published results). Efficiency, in terms of execution time, is found to be highly dependent on the computer system setup.},

The many-body methods include novel variants of both coupled-cluster and configuration-interaction approaches along with methods based on the algebraic diagrammatic construction and variational reduced density-matrix methods. Methods highlighted in Q-Chem 5 include a suite of tools for modeling core-level spectroscopy, methods for describing metastable resonances, methods for computing vibronic spectra, the nuclear\textendash electronic orbital method, and several different energy decomposition analysis techniques. High-performance capabilities including multithreaded parallelism and support for calculations on graphics processing units are described. Q-Chem boasts a community of well over 100 active academic developers, and the continuing evolution of the software is supported by an ``open teamware'' model and an increasingly modular design.},

The technique used is high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy using the Sun as the radiation source, observing the changes in the transmission of the atmosphere as the line-of-sight from the Sun to the spacecraft penetrates the atmosphere close to the Earth's limb at sunrise and sunset. During these periods, interferograms are generated at the rate of one each second which yield, when transformed, high resolution spectra covering the 2.2 to 16 micron region of the infrared. Twenty such occultations were recorded during the Spacelab 3 flight, which have produced concentration profiles for a large number of minor and trace upper atmospheric species in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Several of these species have not previously been observed in spectroscopic data. The data reduction and analysis procedures used following the flight are discussed; a number of examples of the spectra obtained are shown, and a bar graph of the species detected thus far in the analysis is given which shows the altitude ranges for which concentration profiles were retrieved.},

  abstract = {Co-design of alternative fuels and future spark-ignition (SI) engines allows very high engine efficiencies to be achieved. To tailor the fuel's molecular structure to the needs of SI engines with very high compression ratios, computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) of renewable fuels has received considerable attention over the past decade. To date, CAMD for fuels is typically performed by computationally screening the physicochemical properties of single molecules against property targets. However, achievable SI engine efficiency is the result of the combined effect of various fuel properties, and molecules should not be discarded because of individual unfavorable properties that can be compensated for. Therefore, we present an optimization-based fuel design method directly targeting SI engine efficiency as the objective function. Specifically, we employ an empirical model to assess the achievable relative engine efficiency increase compared to conventional RON95 gasoline for each candidate fuel as a function of fuel properties. For this purpose, we integrate the automated prediction of various fuel properties into the fuel design method: Thermodynamic properties are calculated by COSMO-RS; combustion properties, indicators for environment, health and safety, and synthesizability are predicted using machine learning models. The method is applied to design pure-component fuels and binary ethanol-containing fuel blends. The optimal pure-component fuel tert-butyl formate is predicted to yield a relative efficiency increase of approximately 8\% and the optimal fuel blend with ethanol and 3,4-dimethyl-3-propan-2-yl-1-pentene of 19\%.},

Here, we review the commonly used infrared laser absorption spectroscopy techniques for real-time measurements and the significant optical equipment utilized in measuring systems. Then, we discuss practical applications based on infrared laser absorption spectroscopy which require real-time determination of gas component concentrations, including atmospheric environment monitoring, breath analysis, combustion diagnostics, and industrial applications.

  abstract = {Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how molecules react. Species thermochemistry is estimated through Benson group additivity and reaction rate coefficients are estimated using a database of known rate rules and reaction templates. At its core, RMG relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. Graphs are used to represent chemical structures, and trees are used to represent thermodynamic and kinetic data. Models are generated using a rate-based algorithm which excludes species from the model based on reaction fluxes. RMG can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. It also has capabilities for estimating transport and solvation properties, and it automatically computes pressure-dependent rate coefficients and identifies chemically-activated reaction paths. RMG is an object-oriented program written in Python, which provides a stable, robust programming architecture for developing an extensible and modular code base with a large suite of unit tests. Computationally intensive functions are cythonized for speed improvements.

In this context, semantic approaches propose a structure for the target data, defining ontologies that state the types of entities on a certain field and how these entities are interrelated. In this work, we introduce OntoRXN, a novel ontology describing the reaction networks constructed from computational chemistry calculations. Under our paradigm, these networks are handled as undirected graphs, without assuming any traversal direction. From there, we propose a core class structure including reaction steps, network stages, chemical species, and the lower-level entities for the individual computational calculations. These individual calculations are founded on the OntoCompChem ontology and on the ioChem-BD database, where information is parsed and stored in CML format. OntoRXN is introduced through several examples in which knowledge graphs based on the ontology are generated for different chemical systems available on ioChem-BD. Finally, the resulting knowledge graphs are explored through SPARQL queries, illustrating the power of the semantic approach to standardize the analysis of intricate datasets and to simplify the development of complex workflows.},

In our surrogate model approach, the cost of converging the elastic band no longer scales with the number of moving images on the path. This provides a far more efficient and robust transition state search. In contrast to a conventional NEB calculation, the algorithm presented here eliminates any need for manipulating the number of images to obtain a converged result. This is achieved by inventing a new convergence criteria that exploits the probabilistic nature of the GPR to use uncertainty estimates of all images in combination with the force in the saddle point in the target model potential. Our method is an order of magnitude faster in terms of function evaluations than the conventional NEB method with no accuracy loss for the converged energy barrier values.},

In recent years, machine learning has extended the boundaries of quantum chemistry by providing highly accurate and efficient surrogate models of electronic structure theory, which previously have been out of reach for conventional approaches. Those models have long been restricted to closed molecular systems without accounting for environmental influences, such as external electric and magnetic fields or solvent effects. Here, we introduce the deep neural network FieldSchNet for modeling the interaction of molecules with arbitrary external fields. FieldSchNet offers access to a wealth of molecular response properties, enabling it to simulate a wide range of molecular spectra, such as infrared, Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance. Beyond that, it is able to describe implicit and explicit molecular environments, operating as a polarizable continuum model for solvation or in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics setup. We employ FieldSchNet to study the influence of solvent effects on molecular spectra and a Claisen rearrangement reaction. Based on these results, we use FieldSchNet to design an external environment capable of lowering the activation barrier of the rearrangement reaction significantly, demonstrating promising venues for inverse chemical design.},

The procedure is based upon representing an excited state as an excitation from a coupled-cluster ground state and the excitation energies are obtained by solving a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem. Numerical applications are reported for Be and CO, and compared to full CI, Fock space multi-reference coupled-cluster, multi-reference MBPT, and propagator results.}

  abstract = {In this paper the authors develop a method to accurately calculate localized vibrational modes for partially optimized molecular structures or for structures containing link atoms. The method avoids artificially introduced imaginary frequencies and keeps track of the invariance under global translations and rotations. Only a subblock of the Hessian matrix has to be constructed and diagonalized, leading to a serious reduction of the computational time for the frequency analysis. The mobile block Hessian approach (MBH) proposed in this work can be regarded as an extension of the partial Hessian vibrational analysis approach proposed by Head [Int. J. Quantum Chem.\hphantom{,}65, 827 (1997)]. Instead of giving the nonoptimized region of the system an infinite mass, it is allowed to move as a rigid body with respect to the optimized region of the system. The MBH approach is then extended to the case where several parts of the molecule can move as independent multiple rigid blocks in combination with single atoms. The merits of both models are extensively tested on ethanol and di-n-octyl-ether.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

  abstract = {Infrared laser-absorption spectroscopy (IR-LAS) sensors play an important role in diagnosing and characterizing a wide range of combustion systems. Of all the laser-diagnostic techniques, LAS is arguably the most versatile and quantitative, as it has been used extensively to provide quantitative, species-specific measurements of gas temperature, pressure, composition and velocity in both laboratory- and industrial-scale systems. Historically, most IR-LAS work has been conducted using tunable diode lasers; however, today's researchers have access to a wide range of light sources that provide unique sensing capabilities and convenient access to nearly the entire IR spectrum ({$\approx$} 0.8 to 16~\textmu m). In particular, the advent of room-temperature wavelength-tunable mid-infrared semiconductor lasers (e.g., interband- and quantum-cascade lasers) and hyperspectral light sources (e.g., MEMS VCSELs, Fourier-domain mode-locked lasers, dispersed supercontinuum, and frequency combs) has provided a number of unique capabilities that combustion researchers have exploited. The primary goals of this review paper are: (1) to document the recent development, application, and current capabilities of IR-LAS sensors for laboratory- and industrial-scale combustors and propulsion systems, (2) to elucidate the design and use of IR-LAS sensors for combustion gases through a discussion of the modern sensor-design process and state-of-the-art techniques, and (3) to highlight some of the remaining measurement opportunities, challenges, and needs. A thorough review and description of the fundamental spectroscopy governing the accuracy of such sensors, and recent findings and databases that enable improved modeling of molecular absorption spectra will also be provided.},

  abstract = {Organic peroxy radicals (RO2) are key intermediates in the oxidation of organic compounds in both combustion systems and the atmosphere. While many studies have focused on reactions of RO2 in specific applications, spanning a relatively limited range of reaction conditions, the generalized behavior of RO2 radicals across the full range of reaction conditions (temperatures, pressures, and NO levels) has, to our knowledge, never been explored. In this work, two simple model systems, n-propyl peroxy radical and {$\gamma$}-isobutanol peroxy radical, are used to evaluate RO2 fate using pressure-dependent kinetics. The fate of these radicals was modeled based on literature data over 250\textendash 1250 K, 0.01\textendash 100 bar, and 1 ppt to 100 ppm of NO, which spans the typical range of atmospheric and combustion conditions. Covering this entire range provides a broad overview of the reactivity of these species under both atmospheric and combustion conditions, as well as under conditions intermediate to the two. A particular focus is on the importance of reactions that were traditionally considered to occur in only one of the two sets of conditions: RO2 unimolecular isomerization reactions (long known to occur in combustion systems but only recently appreciated in atmospheric systems) and RO2 bimolecular reactions of RO2 with NO (thought to occur mainly in atmospheric systems and rarely considered in combustion chemistry).},

The nonparallelity errors (NPEs), which are defined as an absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the errors in the potential energy along bond-breaking curves, are analyzed for (i) the entire range of nuclear distortions from equilibrium to the dissociation limit and (ii) in the intermediate range (2.5-4.5 \AA ), which is the most relevant for kinetics modeling. For methane, the spin-flip and MR results are compared against full configuration interaction (FCI). For the entire potential energy curves, the NPEs for the SF model with single and double substitutions (SF-CCSD) are slightly less than 3 kcal/mol. Inclusion of triple excitations reduces the NPEs to 0.32 kcal/mol. The corresponding NPEs for the MR-CI are less than 1 kcal/mol, while those of multireference perturbation theory are slightly larger (1.2 kcal/mol). The NPEs in the intermediate range are smaller for all of the methods. The largest errors of 0.35 kcal/mol are observed, surprisingly, for a spin-flip approach that includes triple excitations, while MR-CI, CASPT2, and SF-CCSD curves are very close to each other and are within 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol of FCI. For a larger basis set, the difference between MR-CI and CASPT2 is about 0.2 kcal/mol, while SF-CCSD is within 0.4 kcal/mol of MR-CI. For the C-C bond breaking in ethane, the results of the SF-CCSD are within 1 kcal/mol of MR-CI for the entire curve and within 0.4 kcal/mol in the intermediate region. The corresponding NPEs for CASPT2 are 1.8 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Including the effect of triples by energy-additivity schemes is found to be insignificant for the intermediate region. For the entire range of nuclear separations, sufficiently large basis sets are required to avoid artifacts at small internuclear separations.},

  abstract = {The semiempirical tight-binding based quantum chemistry method GFN2-xTB is used in the framework of meta-dynamics (MTD) to globally explore chemical compound, conformer, and reaction space. The biasing potential given as a sum of Gaussian functions is expressed with the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) in Cartesian space as a metric for the collective variables. This choice makes the approach robust and generally applicable to three common problems (i.e., conformer search, chemical reaction space exploration in a virtual nanoreactor, and for guessing reaction paths). Because of the inherent locality of the atomic RMSD, functional group or fragment selective treatments are possible facilitating the investigation of catalytic processes where, for example, only the substrate is thermally activated. Due to the approximate character of the GFN2-xTB method, the resulting structure ensembles require further refinement with more sophisticated, for example, density functional or wave function theory methods. However, the approach is extremely efficient running routinely on common laptop computers in minutes to hours of computation time even for realistically sized molecules with a few hundred atoms. Furthermore, the underlying potential energy surface for molecules containing almost all elements (Z = 1\textendash 86) is globally consistent including the covalent dissociation process and electronically complicated situations in, for example, transition metal systems. As examples, thermal decomposition, ethyne oligomerization, the oxidation of hydrocarbons (by oxygen and a P450 enzyme model), a Miller-Urey model system, a thermally forbidden dimerization, and a multistep intramolecular cyclization reaction are shown. For typical conformational search problems of organic drug molecules, the new MTD(RMSD) algorithm yields lower energy structures and more complete conformer ensembles at reduced computational effort compared with its already well performing predecessor.},

  abstract = {A simple chemical surrogate fuel model may not be able to fully reproduce the chemical behavior in real fuel combustion. A structure\textendash chemical reactivity relationship at the molecular level is believed to be useful in tuning the chemical composition of reported surrogate fuel models. This work proposes an approach to predict a component fraction of a RP-3 surrogate fuel model with a combined method of ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning. There are four major steps to get a refined surrogate fuel model on the basis of parent RP-3 fuel models with two, three, or four components. Step 1 helps to prepare chemical reactivity data as the input of machine learning. The chemical reactivity data are described by the oxidation reactions in terms of dynamic species concentration with time that were prepared with ReaxFF MD simulations for each derived fuel model generated from the RP-3 parent fuel model by randomly changing its component fraction. Step 2 fits a component fraction prediction model between a single surrogate component fraction and its chemical reactivity data among the common reaction space in oxidation of possible RP-3 surrogates and a 45-component RP-3 fuel with the machine-learning method. The best performance model of LightGBM was selected among the machine-learning models of linear regression, support vector regression, and LightGBM based on the training error evaluation. Each refined component fraction of RP-3 surrogate models was predicted one by one using the trained LightGBM model with the input of dynamic species concentration data of the 45-component RP-3 fuel model better representing real RP-3 fuel. Step 3 helps to select one refined surrogate model among the predicted surrogate models with two, three, or four components by comparing the chemical reactivity deviation of important species with additional ReaxFF MD simulations under the conditions of heat-up, isothermal oxidation, and isothermal pyrolysis. The optimal model of the refined three-component RP-3 surrogate is validated in step 4 where its predicted ignition delay time is found to be closer to the reported experimental data of the real RP-3 fuel than to its parent surrogate fuel model. This work suggests that the proposed computational approach by combining ReaxFF MD simulations and machine learning should be potentially useful in search for refined RP-3 chemical surrogate fuel models directly on the basis of chemical reactivity data in oxidation at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {Traffic remains a major source of urban air pollution although emission regulations have led to significant reductions in exhaust emissions of new vehicles. In this work the photochemical transformation of exhaust emissions from gasoline and diesel passenger vehicles compliant with the current European `Euro6' emission standard and operated with traditional and alternative fuels was investigated using an environmental chamber. By assessing four different engine operation conditions, we show that vehicle operation notably affects the exhaust composition and secondary aerosol formation potential. For the gasoline vehicle, secondary aerosols dominate the total particulate emissions. In contrast, we observe no substantial secondary aerosol formation for exhaust emissions of a Euro6-level diesel vehicle. High engine load operation and cold start of the gasoline vehicle led to 11\textendash 470-fold particulate mass enhancement, while for moderate driving conditions the enhancement ratio was below 2. High aerosol enhancements also led to strong increases in particle light absorption. The results underline the necessity for future directives to include the emission components leading to secondary pollution, in addition to the freshly emitted pollutants. The link observed between secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and gaseous aromatic hydrocarbon emissions suggests that monitoring and limiting these gaseous species can provide an indirect regulation for SOA. Additionally, ammonia released as a byproduct of the gasoline vehicle is confirmed as an important precursor for secondary aerosols.},

These include measurements made aboard the NOAA WP-3 and BAe-146 aircraft, the NOAA research vessel Ronald H. Brown, and at the Thompson Farm and Chebogue Point surface sites during the summer 2004 ICARTT campaign. Both winter and summer 2002 measurements during the Pittsburgh Air Quality Study are also included. Lastly, the spring 2002 observations at Trinidad Head, CA, surface measurements made in March 2006 in Mexico City and coincidentally aboard the C-130 aircraft during the MILAGRO campaign and later during the IMPEX campaign off the northwestern United States are incorporated. Concentrations of TOOC in these datasets span more than two orders of magnitude. The daytime mean TOOC ranges from 4.0 to 456 {$\mu$}gC m\&minus;3 from the cleanest site (Trinidad Head) to the most polluted (Mexico City). Organic aerosol makes up 3\&ndash;17\% of this mean TOOC, with highest fractions reported over the northeastern United States, where organic aerosol can comprise up to 50\% of TOOC. Carbon monoxide concentrations explain 46 to 86\% of the variability in TOOC, with highest TOOC/CO slopes in regions with fresh anthropogenic influence, where we also expect the highest degree of mass closure for TOOC. Correlation with isoprene, formaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein also indicates that biogenic activity contributes substantially to the variability of TOOC, yet these tracers of biogenic oxidation sources do not explain the variability in organic aerosol observed over North America. We highlight the critical need to develop measurement techniques to routinely detect total gas phase VOCs, and to deploy comprehensive suites of TOOC instruments in diverse environments to quantify the ambient evolution of organic carbon from source to sink.},

Reactive organic carbon (ROC) species are the fuel of the chemistry of the atmosphere, dominating short-lived emissions, reactivity, and the secondary production of key species such as ozone, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. Despite the central importance of ROC, the diversity and complexity of this class of species has been a longstanding obstacle to developing a comprehensive understanding of how the composition of our atmosphere, and the associated environmental implications, will evolve.

  abstract = {Electron-transfer processes in solution are among the most important reactions in chemistry and biology. The huge number of redox reactions of transition metal ions and complexes, many preparatively important oxidations and reductions of organic compounds, photosynthesis, and metabolism are only a few examples where electron-transfer reactions play a pivotal role. This ubiquity, as well as their relative simplicity, makes them excellent models for the study on a molecular level of chemical reactions in solution. A particularly important question in chemical reaction dynamics in solution is the influence of the solvent on the reaction rate. In this context one distinguishes between static and dynamic solvent effects. Static effects refer to the stabilization of reactants, transition state, and products, that is, how the solvent affects the free energies of these species and the energy of activation. This interpretation of solvent effects on all kinds of chemical reactions is well established. A more recent development is the investigation of the influence of solvent dynamics on the rate of a reaction. The transfer of an electron is usually thought to be triggered by a fluctuation of the dielectric polarization in the surrounding solvent. The dynamics of such fluctuations is determined by the finite response time of the orientational polarization of the solvent. Under certain conditions this dielectric response time can become the rate-determining factor of the reaction. In this article I intend to give a review of these modern developments in the theory and experimental study of electron-transfer processes. We shall see that solvent dynamics may lead to a whole plethora of phenomena in reaction dynamics. The concepts needed for their description are not limited to electron transfer but bear relevance to many other chemical reactions in solution.},

  abstract = {Ab initio quantum chemistry has emerged as an important tool in chemical research and is appliced to a wide variety of problems in chemistry and molecular physics. Recent developments of computational methods have enabled previously intractable chemical problems to be solved using rigorous quantum-mechanical methods. This is the first comprehensive, up-to-date and technical work to cover all the important aspects of modern molecular electronic-structure theory. Topics covered in the book include: * Second quantization with spin adaptation * Gaussian basis sets and molecular-integral evaluation * Hartree-Fock theory * Configuration-interaction and multi-configurational self-consistent theory * Coupled-cluster theory for ground and excited states * Perturbation theory for single- and multi-configurational states * Linear-scaling techniques and the fast multipole method * Explicity correlated wave functions * Basis-set convergence and extrapolation * Calibration and benchmarking of computational methods, with applications to moelcular equilibrium structure, atomization energies and reaction enthalpies. Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory makes extensive use of numerical examples, designed to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each method treated. In addition, statements about the usefulness and deficiencies of the various methods are supported by actual examples, not just model calculations. Problems and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, complete with hints and solutions. This book is a must for researchers in the field of quantum chemistry as well as for nonspecialists who wish to acquire a thorough understanding of ab initio molecular electronic-structure theory and its applications to problems in chemistry and physics. It is also highly recommended for the teaching of graduates and advanced undergraduates.},

  abstract = {Future fuels for compression ignition engines will be required both to reduce the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from fossil sources and to contribute to the reductions in the exhaust levels of pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Via various processes of biological, chemical and physical conversion, feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass and photosynthetic micro-organisms will yield a wide variety of potential fuel molecules. Furthermore, modification of the production processes may allow the targeted manufacture of fuels of specific molecular structure. This paper therefore presents an overview of the effects of fuel molecular structure on the combustion and emissions characteristics of compression ignition engines, highlighting in particular the submolecular features common to a variety of potential fuels. An increase in the straight-chain length of the alkyl moiety reduces the duration of ignition delay, and the introduction of double bonds or branching to an alkyl moiety both increase ignition delay. The movement of a double bond towards the centre of an alkyl chain, or the addition of oxygen to a molecule, can both increase and decrease the duration of ignition delay dependent on the overall fuel structure. Nitrogen oxide emissions are primarily influenced by the duration of fuel ignition delay, but in the case of hydrogen and methane pilot-ignited premixed combustion arise only at flame temperatures sufficiently high for thermal production. An increase in aromatic ring number and physical properties such as the fuel boiling point increase particulate matter emissions at constant combustion phasing.},

  abstract = {Multipole moments such as charge, dipole, and quadrupole are often invoked to rationalize intermolecular phenomena, but a low-order multipole expansion is rarely a valid description of electrostatics at the length scales that characterize nonbonded interactions. This is illustrated by examining several common misunderstandings rooted in erroneous electrostatic arguments. First, the notion that steric repulsion originates in Coulomb interactions is easily disproved by dissecting the interaction potential for Ar2. Second, the Hunter-Sanders model of {$\pi-\pi$} interactions, which is based on quadrupolar electrostatics, is shown to have no basis in accurate calculations. Third, curved ``buckybowls'' exhibit unusually large dipole moments, but these are ancillary to the forces that control their intermolecular interactions, as illustrated by two examples involving corannulene. Finally, the assumption that interactions between water and small anions are dictated by the dipole moment of H2O is shown to be false in the case of binary halide-water complexes. These examples present a compelling case that electrostatic explanations based on low-order multipole moments are very often counterfactual for nonbonded interactions at close range and should not be taken seriously in the absence of additional justification.},

A stabilization of the endohedral complex is predicted by all methods, but the depth of the potential energy well is overestimated by the DFT+Disp and MP2 approaches. On the other hand, the MP2C model agrees well with DFT-SAPT, which serves as the reference. The performance of SCS-MP2 is mixed: it produces too low interaction energies for the two heavier guests, while its accuracy for He@C60 and Ne@C60 is similar to that of MP2C. Fitting formulas for the main interaction energy components, i.e. the dispersion and first-order repulsion energies are proposed, which are applicable for both endo- and exohedral cases. For all examined methods density fitting is used to evaluate two-electron repulsion integrals, which is indispensable to allow studies of noncovalent complexes of this size. It has been found that density-fitting auxiliary basis sets cannot be used in a black-box fashion for the calculation of the first-order SAPT electrostatic energy, and that the quality of these basis sets should be always carefully examined in order to avoid an unphysical long-range behavior.},

  abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 \texttimes{} 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

  abstract = {We develop an efficient method to compute the electrostatic component of the solvation free energy via the two-point Pad\'e approximation. The Pad\'e approximant uses four parameters to describe the electrostatic free energy change of the solvation process, which could be readily determined from four thermodynamic properties obtained in two simulations, namely, the first- and second-order free energy gradients of any two states. Therefore, instead of sampling at multiple intermediate states, only two states, e.g., electrostatically fully solvated and desolvated, are needed to determine the Pad\'e approximant and compute the corresponding free energy contribution. Applications to several model systems, including both neutral and charged species, show that the method can accurately produce electrostatic solvation free energy. The method would be very useful to save computational cost in applications in which accurate but expensive energy functions like quantum mechanics are used.},

LASP features with the global neural network (G-NN) potential that is generated by learning the first principles dataset of global PES from stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization. The combination of the SSW method with global NN potential facilitates greatly the PES exploration for a wide range of complex materials. Not limited to SSW-NN global optimization, the software implements standard interfaces to dock with other energy/force evaluation packages and can also perform common tasks for computing PES properties, such as single-ended and double-ended transition state search, the molecular dynamics simulation with and without restraints. A few examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and capabilities of LASP code. Our ongoing efforts for code developing and G-NN potential library building are also presented.

  abstract = {The interaction between sunlight and drugs can lead to phototoxicity in patients who have received such drugs. Phototoxicity assessment is a regulatory requirement globally and one of the main toxicity screening steps in the early stages of drug discovery. An in silico-in vitro approach has been utilized mainly for toxicology assessments at these stages. Although several quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for phototoxicity have been developed, in silico technology to evaluate phototoxicity has not been well established. In this study, we attempted to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the in vitro Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test results from a chemical structure and its derived information. To accomplish this, we utilized an open-source software library, kMoL. kMoL employs a graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) approach, which allows it to learn the data for the specified chemical structure. kMoL also utilizes the integrated gradient (IG) method, enabling it to visually display the substructures contributing to any positive results. To construct this AI model, we used only the chemical structure as a basis, then added the descriptors and the HOMO-LUMO gap, which was obtained from quantum chemical calculations. As a result, the assortment of chemical structures and the HOMO-LUMO gap produced an AI model with high discrimination performance, and an F1 score of 0.857. Additionally, our AI model could visualize the substructures involved in phototoxicity using the IG method. Our AI model can be applied as a toxicity screening method and could enhance productivity in drug development.},

  abstract = {This paper presents our vision of how to use in silico approaches to extract the reaction mechanisms and kinetic parameters for complex condensed-phase chemical processes that underlie important technologies ranging from combustion to chemical vapor deposition. The goal is to provide an analytic description of the detailed evolution of a complex chemical system from reactants through various intermediates to products, so that one could optimize the efficiency of the reactive processes to produce the desired products and avoid unwanted side products. We could start with quantum mechanics (QM) to ensure an accurate description; however, to obtain useful kinetics we need to average over {$\sim$}10-nm spatial scales for {$\sim$}1 ns, which is prohibitively impractical with QM. Instead, we use the reactive force field (ReaxFF) trained to fit QM to carry out the reactive molecular dynamics (RMD). We focus here on showing that it is practical to extract from such RMD the reaction mechanisms and kinetics information needed to describe the reactions analytically. This analytic description can then be used to incorporate the correct reaction chemistry from the QM/ReaxFF atomistic description into larger-scale simulations of {$\sim$}10 nm to micrometers to millimeters to meters using analytic approaches of computational fluid dynamics and/or continuum chemical dynamics. In the paper we lay out the strategy to extract the mechanisms and rate parameters automatically without the necessity of knowing any details of the chemistry. We consider this to be a proof of concept. We refer to the process as RMD2Kin (reactive molecular dynamics to kinetics) for the general approach and as ReaxMD2Kin (ReaxFF molecular dynamics to kinetics) for QM-ReaxFF\textendash based reaction kinetics.},

  abstract = {The evolution of atmospheric organic carbon as it undergoes oxidation has a controlling influence on concentrations of key atmospheric species, including particulate matter, ozone and oxidants. However, full characterization of organic carbon over hours to days of atmospheric processing has been stymied by its extreme chemical complexity. Here we study the multigenerational oxidation of {$\alpha$}-pinene in the laboratory, characterizing products with several state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Although quantification of some early~generation products remains elusive, full carbon closure is achieved (within measurement uncertainty) by the end of the experiments. These results provide new insights into the effects of oxidation on organic carbon properties (volatility, oxidation state and reactivity) and the atmospheric lifecycle of organic carbon. Following an initial period characterized by functionalization reactions and particle growth, fragmentation reactions dominate, forming smaller species. After approximately one day of atmospheric aging, most carbon is sequestered in two long-lived reservoirs\textemdash volatile oxidized gases and low-volatility particulate matter.},

  abstract = {In this perspective, the various measures of electron correlation used in wave function theory, density functional theory and quantum information theory are briefly reviewed. We then focus on a more traditional metric based on dominant weights in the full configuration solution and discuss its behavior with respect to the choice of the N-electron and the one-electron basis. The impact of symmetry is discussed, and we emphasize that the distinction among determinants, configuration state functions and configurations as reference functions is useful because the latter incorporate spin-coupling into the reference and should thus reduce the complexity of the wave function expansion. The corresponding notions of single determinant, single spin-coupling and single configuration wave functions are discussed and the effect of orbital rotations on the multireference character is reviewed by analyzing a simple model system. In molecular systems, the extent of correlation effects should be limited by finite system size and in most cases the appropriate choices of one-electron and N-electron bases should be able to incorporate these into a lowcomplexity reference function, often a single configurational one.},

To illustrate its performance, the revised Das function was implemented in the multipole first-order electrostatic and second-order dispersion (MED) scoring model. The extension has allowed applications to a much larger set of biocomplexes than it was possible with the original Das. A reasonable correlation between MED and experimentally determined inhibitory activities was achieved in a number of test cases, including structures featuring nonphysically shortened intermonomer distances, which constitute a particular challenge for binding strength predictions. Since the MED model is also computationally efficient, it can be used for reliable and rapid assessment of the ligand affinity or multidimensional scanning of amino acid side-chain conformations in the process of rational design of novel drugs or biocatalysts.},

  abstract = {We present a method to calculate both normal Raman-scattering (NRS) and resonance Raman-scattering (RRS) spectra from the geometrical derivatives of the frequency-dependent polarizability. In the RRS case, the polarizability derivatives are calculated from resonance polarizabilities by including a finite lifetime of the electronic excited states using time-dependent density-functional theory. The method is a short-time approximation to the Kramers, Heisenberg, and Dirac formalism. It is similar to the simple excited-state gradient approximation method if only one electronic excited state is important, however, it is not restricted to only one electronic excited state. Since the method can be applied to both NRS and RRS, it can be used to obtain complete Raman excitation profiles. To test the method we present the results for the S2 state of uracil and the S4,S3, and S2 states of pyrene. As expected, the results are almost identical to the results obtained from the excited-state gradient approximation method. Comparing with the experimental results, we find in general quite good agreement which enables an assignment of the experimental bands to bands in the calculated spectrum. For uracil the inclusion of explicit waters in the calculations was found to be necessary to match the solution spectra. The calculated resonance enhancements are on the order of 104\textendash 106, which is in agreement with experimental findings. For pyrene the method is also able to distinguish between the three different electronic states for which experimental data are available. The neglect of anharmonicity and solvent effects in the calculations leads to some discrepancy between theory and experiment.},

The method is based on a short-time approximation to Raman scattering and is, in the off-resonance case, identical to the standard theory of Placzek. The normal and resonance VROA spectra are calculated from geometric derivatives of the different generalized polarizabilites obtained using linear response theory which includes a damping term to account for the finite lifetime. Gauge-origin independent results for normal VROA have been ensured using either the modified-velocity gauge or gauge-included atomic orbitals. For the resonance VROA only the modified-velocity gauge has been implemented.

Such photoreactions are triggered by triplet photosensitizers, which absorb visible-light photons and transfer the energy to the substrate or to a co-catalyst through triplet\textendash triplet energy transfer (TT EnT). The most popular triplet photosensitizers, metal complexes and organic chromophores, have proven useful in a range of pericyclic reactions, bond dissociations, and isomerizations, but they have several characteristics related to their chemical and electronic structure that limit their selectivity, energy efficiency, and sustainability. This Perspective describes some ways that colloidal quantum dots (QDs) address the limitations of molecular photocatalysts for TT EnT-driven organic transformations. These sub-5-nm particles have the large catalytic surface area and electronic/optical tunability of homogeneous catalysts, and the easy separation and surface templating effects of heterogeneous catalysts. Their optical and electronic properties, small singlet\textendash triplet energy splitting, narrow emission line widths, and high photostability enhance their performance as triplet photosensitizers. This Perspective describes these advantages in the context of published and ongoing investigations of TT EnT-driven reactions, and then highlights the advantages and challenges associated with using related emerging materials, specifically lead halide perovskite QDs and quasi-2D nanoplatelets, as photocatalysts for triplet excited state chemistry.},

Bader charge analysis is first performed to analyze the surface atomic partial charges. The CH4 adsorption densities in defective and functionalized graphite slit pores are lower than that in the perfect pore according to the MD simulations. Finally, the CH4 adsorption isotherms for the perfect, defective and functionalized slit pores are analyzed by the GCMC simulations in combination of the DFT and MD results. For pores with defective surface, the adsorption capacities decrease; while the embedded functional groups decrease the adsorption capacity at low pressure and enhance it at high pressure. Our results demonstrate the significant effects of chemical and structural surface heterogeneity on the CH4 adsorption and provide a systematic approach to understand the gas adsorption behaviour.},

  abstract = {We report an ab initio study of the effect of vinyl substitution on the cycloaromatization of 3-ene-1,5-diynes (the Bergman cyclization). The majority of the calculations were conducted by using the BLYP version of Density Functional Theory, and higher level Brueckner orbital calculations were used for a few key compounds. In all, 46 enediynes, 44 cyclization transition states, 39 singlet p-benzynes, and 28 related triplet p-benzynes were studied, including simple vinyl-substituted and annulated examples. The data indicate that strongly electron-withdrawing groups increase the cyclization barrier, while {$\sigma$}-donating groups decrease it; {$\pi$} conjugation, especially donation, has little effect. Most annulations, including those involving heteroaromatic rings, lower the barrier slightly (6 MR) or raise it slightly (5 MR). Larger effects are seen for smaller rings or charged rings. Some previously observed apparent rate inhibitions are seen to be due to reversibility or forward reactivity of the intermediate p-benzynes, which are thereby inhibited from the H abstraction step that completes cycloaromatization. H abstraction reactivity, as judged from the p-benzyne singlet-triplet energy gap and from isodesmic equations, is also examined. Unexpected behavior is predicted for some heteroaromatic systems. Finally, we anticipate how these results may be applied to the design of prodrug candidates for subsequent biological application.},

  abstract = {Glucose pyrolysis, a model system in biomass utilization, is renowned for its great complexity, deep in reaction network hierarchy and rich in reaction patterns. The selectivity in glucose pyrolysis, e.g., the high yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a value-added platform product, remains an intriguing puzzle even after 60 years of experimental study. Here we resolve the whole reaction network of glucose pyrolysis using a global-to-global technique for reaction pathway sampling. This is achieved by establishing the first organic chemistry reaction database via stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization, building the global neural network (G-NN) potential via machine learning and extensively exploring the reaction network of glucose pyrolysis. In total, 6407 elementary reactions, screened out from more than 150\,000 reaction pairs in glucose pyrolysis, are collected in our reaction database. The established reaction network from SSW-NN, further validated by first-principles calculations, reveals that for glucose to HMF, the lowest energy reaction pathway involves fructose and 3-deoxyglucos-2-ene (3-DGE) as key intermediates and a site-selective reaction type, retro-Michael-addition, for three consecutive dehydration steps. The overall barrier is determined to be 1.91 eV, being at least 0.19 eV lower than all previously proposed mechanisms, which assumes direct {$\beta$}-H elimination dehydration. The lowest pathways to the other two major products, furfural (FF) and hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA), are also discovered with a similar barrier 1.95 eV, which exhibit a competing nature by sharing the same key intermediate, 3-ketohexose. Since chemical reactions occurring in fast glucose pyrolysis are generally present in biomass chemistry, containing essentially all reaction patterns of C\textendash H\textendash O elements, the methodology designed and the results presented would help to advance reaction design and mechanistic modeling in renewable fuels from biomass.},

  abstract = {Molecular diagnostic ratios (MDRs)\textemdash the ratios of defined pairs of individual compounds\textemdash have been widely used as markers of different source categories of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, it is well-known that variations in combustion conditions and environmental degradation processes can cause substantial variability in the emission and degradation of individual compounds, potentially undermining the application of MDRs as reliable source apportionment tools. The United Kingdom produces a national inventory of atmospheric emissions of PAHs, and has an ambient air monitoring program at a range of rural, semirural, urban, and industrial sites. The inventory and the monitoring data are available over the past 20 years (1990\textendash 2010), a time frame that has seen known changes in combustion type and source. Here we assess 5 MDRs that have been used in the literature as source markers. We examine the spatial and temporal variability in the ratios and consider whether they are responsive to known differences in source strength and types between sites (on rural\textendash urban gradients) and to underlying changes in national emissions since 1990. We conclude that the use of these 5 MDRs produces contradictory results and that they do not respond to known differences (in time and space) in atmospheric emission sources. For example, at a site near a motorway and far from other evident emission sources, the use of MDRs suggests ``non-traffic'' emissions. The ANT/(ANT + PHE) ratio is strongly seasonal at some sites; it is the most susceptible MDR to atmospheric processes, so these results illustrate how weathering in the environment will undermine the effectiveness of MDRs as markers of source(s). We conclude that PAH MDRs can exhibit spatial and temporal differences, but they are not valid markers of known differences in source categories and type. Atmospheric sources of PAHs in the UK are probably not dominated by any single clear and strong source type, so the mixture of PAHs in air is quickly ``blended'' away from the influence of the few major point sources which exist and further weathered in the environment by atmospheric reactions and selective loss processes.},

A feasible strategy for efficient prediction is to utilize chemical heuristics. Here, we propose a novel approach to rapidly search reaction paths in a fully automated fashion by combining chemical theory and heuristics. A key idea of our method is to extract a minimal reaction network composed of only favorable reaction pathways from the complex chemical space through molecular graph and reaction network analysis. This can be done very efficiently by exploring the routes connecting reactants and products with minimum dissociation and formation of bonds. Finally, the resulting minimal network is subjected to quantum chemical calculations to determine kinetically the most favorable reaction path at the predictable accuracy. As example studies, our method was able to successfully find the accepted mechanisms of Claisen ester condensation and cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation reactions.},

As a result, theoretical chemistry is playing an increasingly significant role in the combustion modeling enterprise. The accurate prediction of the temperature and pressure dependence of gas phase reactions requires state-of-the-art implementations of a variety of theoretical methods: ab initio electronic structure theory, transition state theory, classical trajectory simulations, and the master equation. In this work, we illustrate the current state-of-the-art in predicting the kinetics of gas-phase reactions through sample calculations for some prototypical reactions central to combustion chemistry. These studies are used to highlight the success of theory, as well as its remaining challenges, through comparisons with experiments ranging from elementary reaction kinetics studies through to global observations such as flame speed measurements. The illustrations progress from the treatment of relatively simple abstraction and addition reactions, which proceed over a single transition state, through to the complexity of multiwell multichannel reactions that commonly occur in studies of the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition to providing high quality rate prescriptions for combustion modelers, theory will be seen to indicate various shortcomings in the foundations of chemical modeling. Future progress in the fidelity of the chemical modeling of combustion will benefit from more widespread applications of theoretical chemical kinetics and from increasingly intimate couplings of theory, experiment, and modeling.},

  abstract = {Modern quantum chemistry can make quantitative predictions on an immense array of chemical systems. However, the interpretation of those predictions is often complicated by the complex wave function expansions used. Here we show that an exceptionally simple algebraic construction allows for defining atomic core and valence orbitals, polarized by the molecular environment, which can exactly represent self-consistent field wave functions. This construction provides an unbiased and direct connection between quantum chemistry and empirical chemical concepts, and can be used, for example, to calculate the nature of bonding in molecules, in chemical terms, from first principles. In particular, we find consistency with electronegativities ({$\chi$}), C 1s core-level shifts, resonance substituent parameters ({$\sigma$}R), Lewis structures, and oxidation states of transition-metal complexes.},

A disclosure of the underlying reaction mechanisms is challenging due to the rapid nature of these processes and the intricate identification of how many solvent molecules are involved. Here combining broadband femtosecond transient absorption and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we show for one of the most reactive species, diphenylcarbene, that the decision-maker is not the nearest solvent molecule but its neighbour. The hydrogen bonding dynamics determine which reaction channels are accessible in binary solvent mixtures at room temperature. In-depth analysis of the amount of nascent intermediates corroborates the importance of a hydrogen-bonded complex with a protic solvent molecule, in striking analogy to complexes found at cryogenic temperatures. Our results show that adjacent solvent molecules take the role of key abettors rather than bystanders for the fate of the reactive intermediate.},

Since reactive molecular dynamics can be used to discover reaction networks in a largely automated fashion, this method has the potential to drastically reduce the real time effort necessary for the development of reaction models. With standard reactive molecular dynamics, the simulation of low-temperature reaction processes is hindered by the small accessible time scales of only a few nanoseconds. In this work, we propose the pressure-accelerated dynamics method to overcome the time scales obstacle through exploitation of Le Chatelier's principle. For the example of pentane low-temperature ignition, we show that with pressure-accelerated dynamics, the ReaxFF reactive force field, and the ChemTraYzer not only the known key low-temperature igniton pathways can be found, but also reactions that are not yet included in reaction models.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing scientific and engineering disciplines owing to its ability to capture hidden patterns in large amounts of data. The recent success of ML can be attributed to increasing amount of data, simulation resources, and improving understanding of statistical inference. For these reasons computational materials science is undergoing a paradigm shift. The main reason is that trial-and-error approach to materials design is inefficient: laboratory trials require a lot of time, and the results of previous trials are not utilized in a systematic fashion. A data-driven approach, which draws upon all relevant data from experiments, and reactive and quantum molecular dynamics simulations, can address these issues. The MAGICS (Materials Genome Innovation for Computational Software) Center develops to aid the synthesis of stacked layered materials by chemical vapor deposition, exfoliation, and intercalation. The identification of different phases is a classification problem and can be solved using ML techniques. We have used feed-forward neural network with three hidden layers to identify the different phases present during computational synthesis of MoSe2. Our goal is to carry out exascale MD simulations using forces for multimillion-atom quantum dynamics simulations from neural networks and deep learning using small QMD simulations.},

Both closed and open shell singlet states are described within a single reference formalism as spin-flipping, e.g., ? ??, excitations from a triplet (Ms=1) reference state for which both dynamical and non-dynamical correlation effects are much smaller than for the corresponding singlet state.

It focuses on applications of EOM-CC to electronically excited and open-shell species. The examples emphasize EOM's advantages for selected situations often perceived as multireference cases [e.g., interacting states of different nature, Jahn-Teller (JT) and pseudo-JT states, dense manifolds of ionized states, diradicals, and triradicals].

  abstract = {Molecular triplet sensitization using colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) is important for many photochemical and photonic applications. Current QD sensitizers often contain toxic elements such as Cd and Pb. In order to ``go green'' with these sensitizers, we investigate triplet energy transfer from InP-based QDs. Time-resolved spectroscopy studies revealed picosecond hole trapping in core-only QDs, which could complicate and/or inhibit energy transfer. We therefore developed InP/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs that effectively suppressed hole trapping and meanwhile allowed for triplet energy transfer to surfaceanchored anthracene acceptors with an efficiency of 84\%. The sensitized molecular triplets participated in triplet-tripletannihilation, enabling photon upconversion with a normalized quantum yield reaching 10.0\% {$\pm$} 0.1\%. This study demonstrates that nontoxic InP-based QDs can be engineered to be on par with state-of-the-art Cd- or Pb-containing QDs for use as triplet sensitizers.},

In conjunction with a polarisable continuum model (PCM), SES-SWIG discretisation affords continuum electrostatics that vary smoothly with respect to the nuclear coordinates, with a solvation energy that is analytically differentiable with respect to those coordinates. If the SES is the desired cavity construction, then the PCM + SES-SWIG method represents an efficient, boundary-element alternative to three-dimensional, finite-difference solution of Poisson's equation. The algorithm introduced here allows the SES to be constructed and discretised quickly and easily, and its analytically differentiable form paves the way for derivation of analytic gradients.},

Graph-theoretic methods combined with quantum calculations are known to be an efficient approach with broad applicability for constructing reaction networks. However, this method entails high computational cost due to quantum calculations on chemically irrelevant intermediates coming from the exploration of a large scale chemical space. To remedy this problem, we propose to apply the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to those graph-theoretic methods. We have combined it with ACE-Reaction, our in-house graph-theoretic method, and demonstrated its performance on five organic reactions. The result shows that the computational cost for quantum calculations has been reduced by up to 75 \% from that of the original ACE-Reaction. Furthermore, cost reduction became more efficient for more complex reactions.},

Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation, for generic chemical problems where heuristic quantum state preparation might be assumed to be efficient. The availability of exponential quantum advantage then centers on whether features of the physical problem that enable efficient heuristic quantum state preparation also enable efficient solution by classical heuristics. Through numerical studies of quantum state preparation and empirical complexity analysis (including the error scaling) of classical heuristics, in both ab initio and model Hamiltonian settings, we conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for ground-state quantum chemistry through polynomial speedups, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem.},

By means of dispersion-corrected density functional theory computations, we demonstrated that considerable CH/{$\pi$} interactions exist between graphene and its fully (graphane) or patterned partially (C4H) hydrogenated derivatives. Due to the equivalence breaking of two sublattices of graphene, a 90 meV band gap is opened in the graphene/C4H bilayer. The band gap can be further increased to 270 meV by sandwiching graphene between two C4H layers. By taking advantage of the similar SiH/ {$\pi$} interactions, a 120 meV band gap also can be opened for silicene. Interestingly, the high carrier mobility of graphene/silicene can be well-preserved. Our theoretical results suggest a rather practical solution for gap opening of graphene and silicene, which would allow them to serve as field effect transistors and other nanodevices.},

  abstract = {Reactive organic compounds play a central role in the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. The ability to accurately predict their fate, in part, relies upon quantitative knowledge of the chemical and physical parameters associated with the total organic carbon (TOC), which includes both precursors and oxidation products that evolve in the atmosphere over short to long time scales. However, such knowledge, obtained via limited carbon closure experiments, has not been attained for complex anthropogenic emissions. Here we present the first comprehensive characterization of TOC in the atmospheric oxidation of organic vapors from light and heavy oil mixtures associated with oil sand operations. Despite the complexity of the investigated oil mixtures, we are able to achieve carbon closure (83\textendash 116\%) within the uncertainties ({$\pm$}20\%), with the degree of the closure being dependent upon the vapor composition and NOx levels. In contrast to biogenic precursors (e.g., {$\alpha$}-pinene), the photochemical time scale required for a largely complete oxidation and evolution of chemical parameters is very long for the petrochemical vapors (i.e., {$\sim$}7\textendash 10 days vs {$\sim$}1 day), likely due to the lower initial precursor reactivity. This suggests that petrochemical emissions and their impacts are likely to extend further spatially than biogenic emissions, and retain more of their complex composition and reactivity for many days. The results of this work provide key parameters to regional models for further improving the representation of the chemical evolution of petrochemical emissions.},

Particular attention is given to the large-scale ReaxFF MD simulation method of {$\sim$}10,000 atoms and practical simulation strategies to overcome the temporal\textendash spatial limits as much as possible. High-performance computing codes running on CPU cluster/supercomputers and on GPU were overviewed. GPU-enabled code like GMD-Reax is revolutionizing large-scale ReaxFF MD simulations to run mainly on a single GPU. A step-forward for reaction analysis was achieved in the code of VARxMD to reveal detailed reactions based on the identification of bond types and unique species that allows for categorization of reaction species and pathways through structure searching of reaction sites and reactants/products. Efforts for extracting rate constants and kinetics modeling from unperturbed kinetics of ReaxFF MD simulations are reviewed, and challenges remain. The important factors of model scale effects, elevated simulation temperature, and possible validation of ReaxFF MD reaction simulation results theoretically and experimentally are illustrated and discussed. The novel hybrid simulation strategies proposed recently that may expand applications of ReaxFF MD to connect with realistic scenarios of engine combustion and relevant chemical effects on aerospace vehicle materials are briefed. The simulation practices of large-scale ReaxFF MD in understanding the similarities and differences of reactivity and reaction mechanisms in pyrolysis of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, solid fuels (coal, biomass, polymer), and energetic materials of CL-20 and its cocrystals are briefly described, which indicates that large-scale ReaxFF MD simulations are a feasible and straight means to capture the dynamics of an almost entire reaction process and to evaluate reactivity of organic systems computationally. There is still a great deal of work to be done to push the boundaries of ReaxFF MD simulations forward. With the constant improvement of the ReaxFF force field and reaction analysis capability, ReaxFF MD playing a key role in understanding reaction mechanisms and its potential in kinetics modeling of pyrolysis and oxidation of various fuels can be expected.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most important tools for investigating the excited states of electrons. The TDDFT calculation for spin-conserving excitation, where collinear functionals are sufficient, has obtained great success and has become routine. However, TDDFT for noncollinear and spin-flip excitations, where noncollinear functionals are needed, is less widespread and still a challenge nowadays. This challenge lies in the severe numerical instabilities that root in the second-order derivatives of commonly used noncollinear functionals. To be free from this problem radically, noncollinear functionals with numerical stable derivatives are desired, and our recently developed approach, called the multicollinear approach, provides an option. In this work, the multicollinear approach is implemented in noncollinear and spin-flip TDDFT, and prototypical tests are given.}

We resolved extended catacondensed and pentagonal-ring linked (pentalinked) species indicating how small aromatics cross-link and cyclodehydrogenate to form moderately sized aromatics. In addition, we resolved embedded pentagonal and heptagonal rings in flame aromatics. These nonhexagonal rings suggest simultaneous growth through aromatic cross-linking/cyclodehydrogenation and hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition. Moreover, we observed three classes of open-shell {$\pi$}-radical species. First, radicals with an unpaired {$\pi$}-electron delocalized along the molecule's perimeter. Second, molecules with partially localized {$\pi$}-electrons at zigzag edges of a {$\pi$}-radical. Third, molecules with strong localization of a {$\pi$}-electron at pentagonal- and methylene-type sites. The third class consists of {$\pi$}-radicals localized enough to enable thermally stable bonds, as well as multiradical species such as diradicals in the open-shell triplet state. These {$\pi$}-diradicals can rapidly cluster through barrierless chain reactions enhanced by van der Waals interactions. These results improve our understanding of soot formation and the products formed by combustion and could provide insights for cleaner combustion and the production of hydrogen without CO2 emissions.},

  abstract = {Fragment-based methods promise accurate energetics at a cost that scales linearly with the number of fragments. This promise is founded on the premise that the many-body expansion (or another similar energy decomposition) needs to only consider spatially local many-body interactions. Experience and chemical intuition suggest that typically at most four-body interactions are required for high accuracy. Bettens and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014 9, 3699\textemdash 3707] published a detailed study showing that for moderately sized water clusters, basis set superposition error (BSSE) undermines this premise. Ultimately, they were able to overcome BSSE by performing all computations in the supersystem basis set, but such a solution destroys the reduced computational scaling of fragment-based methods. Their findings led them to suggest that there is ``trouble with the many-body expansion''. Since then, a subsequent follow-up study from Bettens and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory. Comput. 2015, 11, 5132\textendash 5143] as well as a related study by Mayer and Bak\'o [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017, 13, 1883\textemdash 1886] have proposed new frameworks for understanding BSSE in the many-body expansion. Although the two frameworks ultimately propose the same working set of equations to the BSSE problem, their interpretations are quite different, even disagreeing on whether or not the solution is an approximation. In this work we propose a more general BSSE framework. We then show that, somewhat paradoxically, the two interpretations are compatible and amount to two different ``normalization'' conditions. Finally, we consider applications of these BSSE frameworks to small water clusters, where we focus on replicating high-accuracy coupled cluster benchmarks. Ultimately, we show for water clusters, using the present framework, that one can obtain results that are within {$\pm$}0.5 kcal mol\textendash 1 of the coupled cluster complete basis set limit without considering anymore than a correlated three-body computation in a quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis set and a four-body triple-{$\zeta$} Hartree\textendash Fock computation.},

  abstract = {Modern research on heterogeneous catalysis calls for new techniques and methods to resolve the active site structure and reaction intermediates at the atomic scale. Here, we overview our recent progress on large-scale atomistic simulation via potential energy surface (PES) global optimization based on neural network (NN) potential, focusing on methodology details and recent applications on catalysis. The combination of stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization and the NN method provides a convenient and automated way to generate the transferable and robust NN potential for global PES, which can be utilized to reveal new chemistry from the unknown region of PES with an affordable computational cost. The predictive power of SSW-NN is demonstrated in several examples, where the method is applied to explore the material crystal phases, to follow the surface structure evolution under high pressure hydrogen and to determine the ternary oxide phase diagram. The limitations and future directions to develop the SSW-NN method are also discussed.},

However, the use of partial atomic charges remains relatively uncommon in the characterization of excited-state electronic structure. Here, we show how wellestablished partial atomic charge methods perform for interatomic, intermolecular, and interbond electron transfer in electronically excited states. Our results demonstrate the utility of real-space partial atomic charges for interpreting the electronic structures that arise in excited-state processes. Furthermore, we show how this analysis can be used to demonstrate that analogous electronic structures arise near photochemically relevant conical intersection regions for several conjugated polyenes. On the basis of our analysis, we find that charges computed using the iterative Hirshfeld approach provide results which are consistent with chemical intuition and are transferable between homologous molecular systems.},

The AFIR method is one of the automated reaction-path search methods developed by the authors, and has been applied extensively to a variety of chemical reactions, such as organocatalysis, organometallic catalysis, and photoreactions. There are two modes in the AFIR method, i.e., a multicomponent mode and a single-component mode. The former has been applied to bimolecular and multicomponent reactions and the latter to unimolecular isomerization and dissociation reactions. Five numerical examples are presented for an Aldol reaction, a Claisen rearrangement, a Co-catalyzed hydroformylation, a fullerene structure search, and a nonradiative decay path search in an electronically excited naphthalene molecule. Finally, possible applications of the AFIR method are discussed.},

One example is the presence of a {$\pi$}-electron-deficient cavity in halogen-substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds, the so-called {$\pi$}-holes, the existence of which was predicted theoretically, but the direct experimental observation is still missing. Here we present the resolution of the {$\pi$}-hole on a single molecule using the Kelvin probe force microscopy, which confirms the theoretical prediction of its existence. In addition, experimental measurements supported by theoretical calculations show the importance of {$\pi$}-holes in the process of adsorption of molecules on solid-state surfaces. This study expands our understanding of the {$\pi$}-hole systems and, at the same time, opens up possibilities for studying the influence of submolecular charge distribution on the chemical properties of molecules and their mutual interaction.},

The spin-conserving variant of the correction is identical to the triples correction of Piecuch and co-workers [Mol. Phys. 104, 2149 (2006)] derived within method-of-moments framework and is not size intensive. The spin-flip variant of the correction is size intensive. The performance of the correction is demonstrated by calculations of electronic excitation energies in methylene, nitrenium ion, cyclobutadiene, ortho-, meta-, and para-benzynes, 1,2,3-tridehydrobenzene, as well as C\textendash C bond breaking in ethane. In all cases except cyclobutadiene, the absolute values of the correction for energy differences were 0.1 eV or less. In cyclobutadiene, the absolute values of the correction were as large as 0.4 eV. In most cases, the correction reduced the errors against the benchmark values by about a factor of 2\textendash 3, the absolute errors being less than 0.04 eV.},

The singular value decomposition method is compared with Shuster's implementation of Davenport's q-method, which is more efficient than the new algorithm but does not give the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. These are often useful for analysis, since the maximum eigenvalue and its eigenvector give the magnitude and direction of the largest component of the attitude uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The local excitation approximation (LEA), a method for the calculation of electronic excitations localized in a specific region of a molecule, has been modified with new approaches to enhance the accuracy of the original method. The primary concept behind LEA involves isolating the region of interest as a submolecule from the full molecule using a localization method, followed by calculating electronic excitations solely within this submolecule. In this study, we examined approaches that improve the accuracy in describing the region of interest, particularly its molecular orbital energies. Additionally, the localization method was extended with a new projection technique to accelerate calculations. These approaches were studied in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations applied to four testing systems with a chromophore as the region of interest: two basic linear molecules, acrolein surrounded by 24 water molecules, and a model of a green fluorescent protein. For all studied systems, the results of TDDFT calculations combined with LEA exhibited near-zero error when groups of atoms adjacent to the chromophore were explicitly included in the submolecule. This was achieved with at least a quadratic speedup of the calculation time as a function of the submolecule size.},

Atomistic simulations employing validated reactive interaction potentials are capable of providing structural information about the time scales involved.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) techniques applied to chemical reactions have a long history. The present contribution discusses applications ranging from small molecule reaction dynamics to computational platforms for reaction planning. ML-based techniques can be particularly relevant for problems involving both computation and experiments. For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to develop models consistent with knowledge from experiments. Second, ML-based methods can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state information in reactive collisions. Finally, the explicit simulation of reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning techniques, and an outlook discusses challenges in this diverse and stimulating field. It is concluded that ML applied to chemistry problems as practiced and conceived today has the potential to transform the way with which the field approaches problems involving chemical reactions, in both research and academic teaching.},

Therefore, precise characterization of the material, including its origins, is a key factor in preventing further, uncontrolled emission and circulation. The magnetic fraction of atmospheric dust was collected in Krak\'ow using a static sampler and analysed using several methods (scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements). The magnetic fraction contains magnetite, hematite and {$\alpha$}-Fe, as well as quartz, feldspar and pyroxene often attached to the magnetic particles. The magnetic particles vary in size, from over 20 \textmu m to nanoparticles below 100 nm, as well as in morphology (irregular or spherical). Their chemical composition is dominated by Fe, often with Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Si, Al, S, Ca and other elements. M\"ossbauer spectroscopy corroborates the composition of the material, giving further indications of particles smaller than 100 nm present in the atmospheric dust. VSM measurements confirm that the strength of the magnetic signal can be treated as a measure of the anthropogenic impact on the suspended particulate matter, once again highlighting the presence of nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Abstract An analytical algorithm, called SETTLE, for resetting the positions and velocities to satisfy the holonomic constraints on the rigid water model is presented. This method is still based on the Cartesian coordinate system and can be used in place of SHAKE and RATTLE. We implemented this algorithm in the SPASMS package of molecular mechanics and dynamics. Several series of molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to examine the performance of the new algorithm in comparison with the original RATTLE method. It was found that SETTLE is of higher accuracy and is faster than RATTLE with reasonable tolerances by three to nine times on a scalar machine. Furthermore, the performance improvement ranged from factors of 26 to 98 on a vector machine since the method presented is not iterative. \textcopyright{} 1992 by John Wiley \{\&\vphantom\}}

  title = {Laboratory and {{Mechanistic Studies}} of {{Volatile Organic Carbon Oxidation Systems}} in the {{Atmosphere}}},
  author = {Moss, Joshua A},
  abstract = {Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) oxidize in the troposphere and significantly influence the formation of pollutants including ground-level ozone, CO2, and particulate matter (PM). Ozone and PM negatively impact human health, and all three pollutants influence Earth's climate. VOCs also dominate the OH reactivity of the atmosphere which in turn influences concentrations of other important radical species including NOx and HO2. Chamber experiments are often conducted to measure VOC oxidation in a controlled laboratory setting, but these studies are may be complicated by vapor deposition on chamber surfaces and potential VOC decomposition in the Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometers (CIMS) which are used to measure a broad range of oxidation products. Mechanistic simulations are also frequently performed to emulate chamber chemistry with less effort and fewer complications than may arise during a chamber experiment, but the results of these simulations are limited by uncertainties and gaps in our understanding of VOC oxidation chemistry from empirical studies. This thesis addresses uncertainties in chamber measurements and mechanisms and uses both in tandem to provide mutual benefits. Chapter 2 focuses on the development and characterization of a Total Suspended Carbon (TSC) apparatus which may be used to parametrize chamber vapor deposition. Chapter 3 centers around the development of new methodology to compare carbon closure chamber datasets and mechanistic datasets using GECKOA as the base mechanism. Comparisons suggest a propensity for the decomposition of nitrate, peroxyacyl nitrate, alcohol, and aldehyde functional groups in the process of being detected by CIMS, so the final comparison methodology is based on carbon number and average carbon oxidation state distributions which are largely unaffected by decomposition. Chapter 4 uses the methodology from Chapter 3 to investigate how targeted edits to GECKO-A mechanism generator affect its overall agreement with chamber observations for {$\alpha$}-pinene, isoprene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene oxidation studies. This chapter highlights reaction pathways of particular importance for each VOC oxidation system and provides new methods to target pathways and specific reactions for further study. Overall, this thesis provides broadly applicable new tools to reduce uncertainty and improve chemical understanding of VOC oxidation systems.},

  abstract = {A reaction route map (RRM) constructed using the GRRM program is a collection of elementary reaction pathways, each of which comprises two equilibrium (EQ) geometries and one transition state (TS) geometry connected by an intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC). An RRM can be mathematically represented by a graph with weights assigned to both vertices, corresponding to EQs, and edges, corresponding to TSs, representing the corresponding energies. In this study, we propose a method to extract topological descriptors of a weighted graph representing an RRM based on persistent homology (PH). The work of Mirth et al. [ J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 154, 114114], in which PH analysis was applied to the (3N \textendash{} 6)-dimensional potential energy surface of an N atomic system, is related to the present method, but our method is practically applicable to realistic molecular reactions. Numerical assessments revealed that our method can extract the same information as the method proposed by Mirth et al. for the 0-th and 1-st PHs, except for the death of the 1-st PH. In addition, the information obtained from the 0-th PH corresponds to the analysis using the disconnectivity graph. The results of this study suggest that the descriptors obtained using the proposed method accurately reflect the characteristics of the chemical reactions and/or physicochemical properties of the system.},

A simple and attractive for- mulation is the lock-and-key analogy defining the host as a lock accommodating the guest as a key. We stress three major aspects of molecular recognition, determining both complementarity between host and guest and similarity within a group of guest molecules. These aspects are: steric, i.e. maximization of close contacts, electrostatic, i.e. maximization of electrostatic attraction between host and guest, as well as hydrophobic, i.e. avoiding hydrophobic hydration, which can be reached by the maximization of apolar contacts between interacting molecules. Some examples are presented from our laboratory: the complexes of acylaminoacyl peptidase with small peptides, the effect of heparin binding on inhibitory potency of C1- inhibitor as well as small-molecule ligand binding to prolyl oligopeptidase and calmodulin.},

Unlike the standard CO expression, the GCO expression is exact within the harmonic approximation. Using two illustrative example molecules, the theoretical concepts introduced here are demonstrated by performing a GCO decomposition of the rotational strengths computed using DFT. This analysis shows that: (1) the contributions to the rotational strengths that are normally neglected in the standard CO model can be comparable to or larger than the CO contribution, and (2) the GCO mechanism introduced here can affect the VCD intensities of all types of modes in symmetric and asymmetric molecules.},

  abstract = {Dimethyl ether (DME)/C1-C4 alkane mixtures are ideal fuel for homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. The comparison of ignition delay and multi-stage ignition for DME/C1-C4 alkane mixtures can provide theoretical guidance for expanding the load range and controlling the ignition time of DME HCCI engines. However, the interaction mechanism between DME and C1-C4 alkane under engine relevant high-pressure and low-temperature conditions remains to be revealed, especially the comprehensive comparison of the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and multi-stage ignition characteristic. Therefore, the CHEMKIN-PRO software is used to calculate the ignition delay process of DME/C1-C4 alkane mixtures (50\%/50\%) at different compressed temperatures (600\textendash 2000 K), pressures (20\textendash 50 bar), and equivalence ratios (0.5\textendash 2.0) and the multi-stage ignition process of DME/C1-C4 alkane mixtures (50\%/50\%) over the temperature of 650 K, pressure of 20 bar, and equivalence ratio range of 0.3\textendash 0.5. The results show that the ignition delay of the mixtures exhibits a typical NTC characteristic, which is more prominent at a low equivalence ratio and pressure range. The initial temperature of DME/CH4 mixtures of the NTC region is the highest. In the NTC region, the ignition delay DME/CH4 mixtures are the shortest, whereas DME/C3H8 mixtures are the longest. At low-temperature and lean-burn conditions, DME/C1-C4 alkane mixtures exhibit a distinct three-stage ignition characteristic. The time corresponding to heat release rate and pressure peak is the shortest for DME/CH4 mixtures, and it is the longest for DME/C3H8 mixtures. Kinetic analysis indicates that small molecular alkane competes with the OH radical produced in the oxidation process of DME, which inhibits the oxidation of DME and promotes the oxidation of small molecular alkane. The concentration of active radicals and the OH radical production rate of elementary reactions are the highest for DME/CH4 mixtures, and they are the lowest for DME/C3H8 mixtures.},

  abstract = {Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, underpinning the properties and reactivity of many organic compounds and materials. The ability to easily and accurately discern aromatic behavior is key to leveraging it as a design element, yet most aromaticity metrics struggle to combine accurate quantitative evaluation, intuitive interpretability, and user-friendliness. We introduce a new method, NICS2BC, which uses simple and inexpensive NICS calculations to generate information-rich and easily-interpreted bond-current graphs. We test the quantitative and qualitative characterizations afforded by NICS2BC for a selection of molecules of varying structural and electronic complexity, to demonstrate its accuracy and ease of analysis. Moreover, we show that NICS2BC successfully identifies ring-current patterns in molecules known to be difficult cases to interpret with NICS and enables deeper understanding of local aromaticity trends, demonstrating that our method adds additional insight.},

However, effects of the higher pressures and replacement of the nitrogen with carbon dioxide diluent are not well understood at present. The title reaction is one of the most important processes in combustion. Despite numerous studies, the effects of supercritical carbon dioxide environment did not receive much attention in the past. Here we report the results of boxed molecular dynamics simulations of these effects at QM/MM theory level with periodical boundary conditions. The free energy barriers for HOCO intermediate formation and decomposition were tabulated in a wide range of pressures (1\textendash 1000 atm) and temperatures (400\textendash 1600 K). Pressure dependence of calculated rate constants for these reaction steps and overall reaction were analyzed. We found that the CO2 environment may increase these rate constants up to a factor of 25, at near critical conditions. At higher temperatures, this effect weakens significantly. Numerical values for parameters of extended Arrhenius equation, suitable for combustion kinetic modeling are reported.},

Instead, the enhancement is found to originate from many intermediate-range contacts distributed throughout the binding pocket, particularly including the peptide bonds in the protein backbone. The contributions from these contacts are primarily electrostatic in nature, but require ab initio computations involving nearly the full drug\textendash protein pocket system to be accurately quantified.},

The approach works well when the approximate DFT is sufficiently accurate to describe the energetics of the low-level subsystem and the coupling between subsystems. It is also necessary that the low-level DFT produces a qualitatively reasonable description of the total density, and in this work, we study model systems where delocalization error prevents this from being the case. We find substantial errors in embedding calculations on open-shell doublet systems in which self-interaction errors cause spurious delocalization of the singly occupied orbital. We propose a solution to this error by evaluating the DFT energy using a more accurate self-consistent density, such as that of Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. These so-called WF-in-(HF-DFT) calculations show excellent convergence towards full-system wavefunction calculations.},

DFTB-MD simulations performed with the same initial conditions (P0, T0) reveal a stochastic behavior, both in terms of reaction times and chemical paths. By running series of MD simulations, we are able to obtain average reaction times with quantified errors and devise a simple two-step model for NM explosion: ignition/explosion. While our model bypasses the chemical complexity due to the numerous reaction paths and intermediates observed during reactions, the chemistry is accounted for via the accurate parameterization of the DFTB model, and our results suggest a single main reaction pathway for the pressure range considered here, dominated in the earlier stages by the formation of the aci-ion, CH2NOO\textendash. By fitting our data to a Frank\textendash Kamenetskii model, we extract prefactors and pressure-independent activation energies and volumes for the ignition and explosion stages. A two-step model is then built and compared to experimental observations. Single and two-step Arrhenius models are also provided for comparison with literature data. This work presents an efficient way of investigating the reactivity of high explosives by performing electronic structure-based MD simulations and provides reaction rates for simplified models that can be implemented into hydrocodes.},

  abstract = {Extensive time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) and DFT/multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations are performed on the singlet and triplet excited states of free-base porphyrin, with emphasis on intersystem crossing processes. The equilibrium geometries, as well as the vertical and adiabatic excitation energies of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states are determined. Single and double proton-transfer reactions in the first excited singlet state are explored. Harmonic vibrational frequencies are calculated at the equilibrium geometries of the ground state and of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states. Furthermore, spin\textendash orbit coupling matrix elements of the lowest singlet and triplet states and their numerical derivatives with respect to nuclear displacements are computed. It is shown that opening of an unprotonated pyrrole ring as well as excited-state single and double proton transfer inside the porphyrin cavity lead to crossings of the potential energy curves of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states. It is also found that displacements along out-of-plane normal modes of the first excited singlet state cause a significant increase of the {$<$}T2|Hso|S1{$>$}, {$<$}T1|Hso|S1{$>$}, and {$<$}T1|Hso|S0{$>$} spin\textendash orbit coupling matrix elements. These phenomena lead to efficient radiationless deactivation of the lowest excited states of free-base porphyrin via intercombination conversion. In particular, the S1\textrightarrow T1 population transfer is found to proceed at a rate of {$\approx$}107 s-1 in the isolated molecule.},

Raman spectroscopy is a promising method for rapid quantitative analysis of the composition of such gases. To improve the accuracy of the method, information is needed on changes in the spectra of the main components as a function of pressure and gas composition. In this work the spectral characteristics of the most intense peaks of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen in the range of 200\textendash 3800\,cm-1 were investigated in the range of 1\textendash 25\,bar for pure gases and binary mixtures. It has been revealed that, under these conditions, the change in the characteristics of pure rotational hydrogen lines is negligible, while the Q-branches of the main vibrational bands of methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide shift to a few tenths of cm-1. The values of errors that can occur in the case of ignoring such changes in the spectra are estimated.},

In this paper, the microscopic reactive behaviors of brown coal combustion in O2/CO2 atmosphere were simulated by combining the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the reactive force field (ReaxFF). With thoroughly tracing the motion trajectories of atoms, as well as the formation, transition and breaking of bonds between atoms, the generation pathways of CO2 and the effects of temperature (1600\textendash 2000\,K) and oxygen concentration (21\%\textasciitilde 30\%) on the coal oxy-fuel combustion process were studied. Results showed that the main process of CO2 generation consists of the decomposition, oxygenation, and dehydrogenation. The atmosphere with a high concentration of CO2 can accelerate the reaction rate of coal combustion and reduce the consumption of O2. The higher temperature will promote the production of major intermediates with more fragments being released earlier, and finally increase the generation of CO2. The increase of O2 concentration obviously hastens the decomposition of coal molecule and the generation of H2O, but shows very weak influence on the distributions of other major products and intermediates.},

  abstract = {Plants synthesize small molecule diterpenes composed of 20 carbons from precursor isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl disphosphate, manufacturing diverse compounds used for defense, signaling, and other functions. Industrially, diterpenes are used as natural aromas and flavoring, as pharmaceuticals, and as natural insecticides or repellents. Despite diterpene ubiquity in plant systems, it remains unknown how plants control diterpene localization and transport. For many other small molecules, plant cells maintain transport proteins that control compound compartmentalization. However, for most diterpene compounds, specific transport proteins have not been identified, and so it has been hypothesized that diterpenes may cross biological membranes passively. Through molecular simulation, we study membrane transport for three complex diterpenes from among the many made by members of the Lamiaceae family to determine their permeability coefficient across plasma membrane models. To facilitate accurate simulation, the intermolecular interactions for leubethanol, abietic acid, and sclareol were parametrized through the standard CHARMM methodology for incorporation into molecular simulations. To evaluate the effect of membrane composition on permeability, we simulate the three diterpenes in two membrane models derived from sorghum and yeast lipidomics data. We track permeation events within our unbiased simulations, and compare implied permeation coefficients with those calculated from Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling calculations using the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion model. The diterpenes are observed to permeate freely through these membranes, indicating that a transport protein may not be needed to export these small molecules from plant cells. Moreover, the permeability is observed to be greater for plant-like membrane compositions when compared against animal-like membrane models. Increased permeability for diterpene molecules in plant membranes suggest that plants have tailored their membranes to facilitate low-energy transport processes for signaling molecules.},

  abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

In this work, we improve the best estimate of the interaction energies in the set by updating their CCSD(T)/CBS and CCSDT(Q) components with calculations in larger basis sets. The data set is then used to test a large number of composite CCSD(T) approaches. Special attention is paid to the use of the explicitly correlated MP2-F12 method in these composite calculations. It is shown that an accuracy of 1\textendash 2\% can be achieved with setups applicable to larger molecules. The effect of frozen natural orbital approximation on the accuracy of composite CCSD(T)/CBS calculations is also quantified. In four trivially saturated complexes where CCSDT(Q)/CBS data are now available, the convergence of the many-body correlation effects is assessed by fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculations. A good agreement is achieved between FN-DMC and high-level coupled-cluster which represents an important cross-check of both approaches.},

  abstract = {Many simulation methods concerning solvated molecules are based on the assumption that the solvated species and the solvent can be characterized by some representative structures of the solute and some embedding potential corresponding to this structure. While the averaging of the solvent configurations to obtain an embedding potential has been studied in great detail, this hinges on a single solute structure representation. This assumption is re-examined and generalized for conformationally flexible solutes and tested on 4 nonrigid systems. In this generalized approach, the solute is characterized by a set of representative structures and the corresponding embedding potentials. The representative structures are identified by means of subdividing the statistical ensemble, which in this work is generated by a constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulation. The embedding potential defined in the Frozen-Density Embedding Theory is used to characterize the average effect of the solvent in each subensemble. The numerical examples concern the vertical excitation energies of protonated retinal Schiff bases in protein environments. It is comprehensively shown that subensemble averaging leads to huge computational savings compared with explicit averaging of the excitation energies in the whole ensemble while introducing only minor errors in the case of the systems examined.},

  abstract = {Recently, the first mixed C/P phosphatetrahedranes (tBuC)3P and (tBuCP)2 were reported. Unlike (tBuCP)2, (tBuC)3P exhibits remarkable thermal stability, which can be partially attributed to a network of nine hydrogen\textendash hydrogen bonds (HHBs) localized between the tert-butyl substituents. The stabilizing contribution arising from this network of HHBs was obtained from local energy decomposition (LED) analysis calculated at the domain-based local pair natural orbital CCSD(T) (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) level of theory. These calculations suggest that each HHB contributes approximately -0.7 kcal/mol of stabilization; however, the net stabilization energy likely lies between -0.25 and -0.5 kcal/mol because of steric repulsion. Spatial analysis of the London dispersion energy via a dispersion interaction density (DID) plot reveals that the DID surface is localized at key C\textendash H groups involved in HHBs, consistent with London dispersion interactions predominantly arising from HHBs. In addition, we present a computed mechanism that supports a phosphinidenoid species as a key reaction intermediate in the synthesis of (tBuC)3P.},

For all elementary reactions in a given reaction network, reaction rate calculations, followed by direct micro-kinetic modelling, enables one to predict macroscopic outcomes (e. g. rate laws, product selectivity) based on atomistic input data. However, for chemical reaction networks containing thousands of reactant molecules, such simulations can be extremely time-consuming; in addition, the complex coupled time-dependence of molecular concentrations can present challenges when seeking essential mechanistic features. In this Article, we instead present an algorithm which seeks to predict the ``most likely'' reaction mechanism, or competing mechanisms, connecting any two user-selected reactant and product species, given a previously-generated reaction network as input. The approach is successfully tested for reaction networks (containing tens of thousands of possible reactions) describing the carbon monoxide oxidation on platinum nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1{$\Sigma$}+g, 3{$\Sigma$}+u and 3{$\Pi$}g) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) \AA; \$\o mega\$e: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm\textbackslash textminus1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

  abstract = {The valence bond (VB) theory uses localized orbitals, and its wave function is composed of a linear combination of various VB structures which are based on sets of spin functions. The VB structures are not unique, and different sets are used, Rumer sets being the most common for classical VB due to their advantage as being both easily obtained as linearly independent and meaningful. Yet, Rumer rules, which are responsible for the simplified process of obtaining the Rumer sets, are very restrictive. Furthermore, Rumer sets are best suited for cyclic systems; however, in noncyclic systems, structures resulting from Rumer rules are often not the most intuitive/suitable structures for these systems. We have developed a method to obtain chemically insightful structures, which is based on concepts of chemical bonding. The method provides sets of VB structures with improved chemical insight, which can also be controlled. Parallel to the Rumer structures, the chemical insight sets of structures are based on electron pair coupling, and hence, pictorially can be drawn similarly to the Lewis structures. Yet, different from Rumer rules, the chemical insight method, being more flexible, allows larger combinations of bonds as well as larger combinations of structures in the sets it offers, resulting in many more possible sets that are better adapted to the systems studied.},

It means that difluorodichloromethane is an effective inhibitor to prevent undesirable ignition of methane-air mixes at atmospheric pressure. It is experimentally shown that the concentration limits of the initiated combustion known from literature are meaningful only for previously prepared mixes. If the mixes are prepared just before the experiment, then the existence or the lack of ignition is determined by both an order of injection of mixture components, and the geometry of an installation. Therefore, the inhibition with halons can hardly be used to address the challenges of safety in mines. Thus, the influence of gasdynamic factors on the efficiency of inhibition is revealed. It is shown that the active centers of hydrogen and methane combustion determining the development of combustion process have the different chemical nature. Vibrationally excited molecules of hydrogen fluoride ({$\nu$}\,=\,2, 3) are for the first time detected in the products of combustion of hydrogen and methane in the presence of difluorodichloromethane by means of hyper spectrometers of visible and near infrared spectral range. It can be promising phenomenon in laser chemical applications.

Overcrowded systems are known to undergo geometric deformations, but the energetically favourable {$\pi$}-electron delocalization of their aromatic ring(s) is typically preserved. In this study we incremented the strain energy of an aromatic system beyond its aromatic stabilization energy, causing it to rearrange and its aromaticity to be ruptured. We noted that increasing the steric bulk around the periphery of {$\pi$}-extended tropylium rings leads them to deviate from planarity to form contorted conformations in which aromatic stabilization and strain are close in energy. Under increasing strain, the aromatic {$\pi$}-electron delocalization of the system is broken, leading to the formation of a non-aromatic, bicyclic analogue referred to as `Dewar tropylium'. The aromatic and non-aromatic isomers have been found to exist in rapid equilibrium with one another. This investigation demarcates the extent of steric deformation tolerated by an aromatic carbocycle and thus provides direct experimental insights into the fundamental nature of aromaticity.},

  abstract = {A review of the various possible definitions of diradicals leads the authors to describe these systems as having two odd electrons in degenerate or nearly-degenerate molecular orbitals. A study of the wave-function for the two odd electrons shows that its form depends entirely on whether the diradical is homo- or heterosymmetric. Energy schemes are given in these two cases, as well as in the intermediate ``non-symmetric'' case. The extent of zwitterionic character in diradical states is also investigated. This is followed by a discussion of intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet diradical states via spin-orbit coupling and other mechanisms. The electronic matrix elements for spin-orbit coupling are calculated and evaluated numerically for various model cases. It is then possible to establish general rules for favorable (electronic) intersystem crossing. In 1,3 or 1,4 diradicals its efficiency is estimated to be comparable with that in aromatics. The role of the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction in mixing singlet and triplet states, particularly in CIDNP, is explained. Finally the question of whether diradicals actually occur as secondary minima on potential energy surfaces is examined. Recent quantum-mechanical calculations, in contradiction to some thermochemical and kinetic evidence, lead to flat singlet surfaces without significant minima.},

Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by the DMRG.},

Pure DFT methods work reasonably well for these reactions; the errors are somewhat larger (ca. 3-7 kcal mol-1) than for the much more time-consuming complete active space (CASPT2) and coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] (both in error by ca. 2 kcal mol-1) methods with high-quality basis sets. The hybrid method B3LYP is unsuitable for this type of chemistry (errors of 14-20 kcal mol-1). The singlet-triplet energy separations ({$\Delta$}EST) for p-benzynes are underestimated systematically by about 2 kcal mol-1 at BLYP; the {$\Delta$}EST of 2-methyl-p-benzyne (-3.1 kcal mol-1) is close to that of p-benzyne (-3.8 kcal mol-1, i.e., singlet ground state) but the 2,3-dimethyl-p-benzyne {$\Delta$}EST is only -0.6 kcal mol-1 due to singlet destabilization (methyl repulsion). 2,3-Dialkyl-p-benzynes thus have nearly degenerate singlet and triplet states. While we find that there is clearly no predictive relationship between the alkyne carbon distance (d) and the cyclization activation enthalpy ({$\Delta$}H{$\thermod$}) for monocyclic enediynes, Nicolaou's empirically determined ``critical range'' of 3.31-3.2 \AA, where spontaneous cyclization should occur at room temperature, should be extended to 3.4-2.9 \AA. However, ring strain effects may become more important than distance arguments. Dimethyl substitution increases the endothermicity of the Bergman reaction (by about 12 kcal mol-1). The cyclization of a nine-membered enediyne is only mildly endothermic; larger rings give larger endothermicities. The formation of final products via double hydrogen abstraction from 1,4-cyclohexadiene is highly exothermic. The exothermicity decreases with increasing ring size due to unfavorable H{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H repulsion in the products.},

  abstract = {Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) has become an invaluable tool for studying the fundamental nature of non-covalent interactions by directly computing the electrostatics, exchange (steric) repulsion, induction (polarization), and London dispersion contributions to the interaction energy using quantum mechanics. Further application of SAPT is primarily limited by its computational expense, where even its most affordable variant (SAPT0) scales as the fifth power of system size [O(N5)] due to the dispersion terms. The algorithmic scaling of SAPT0 is reduced from O(N5) \textrightarrow{} O(N4) by replacing these terms with the empirical D3 dispersion correction of Grimme and co-workers, forming a method that may be termed SAPT0-D3. Here, we optimize the damping parameters for the -D3 terms in SAPT0-D3 using a much larger training set than has previously been considered, namely, 8299 interaction energies computed at the complete-basis-set limit of coupled cluster through perturbative triples [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Perhaps surprisingly, with only three fitted parameters, SAPT0-D3 improves on the accuracy of SAPT0, reducing mean absolute errors from 0.61 to 0.49 kcal mol-1 over the full set of complexes. Additionally, SAPT0-D3 exhibits a nearly 2.5\texttimes{} speedup over conventional SAPT0 for systems with {$\sim$}300 atoms and is applied here to systems with up to 459 atoms. Finally, we have also implemented a functional group partitioning of the approach (F-SAPT0-D3) and applied it to determine important contacts in the binding of salbutamol to G-protein coupled {$\beta$}1-adrenergic receptor in both active and inactive forms. SAPT0-D3 capabilities have been added to the open-source Psi4 software.},

  abstract = {We present an extension of our Molecular Transformer model combined with a hyper-graph exploration strategy for automatic retrosynthesis route planning without human intervention. The single-step retrosynthetic model sets a new state of the art for predicting reactants as well as reagents, solvents and catalysts for each retrosynthetic step. We introduce four metrics (coverage, class diversity, round-trip accuracy and Jensen\textendash Shannon divergence) to evaluate the single-step retrosynthetic models, using the forward prediction and a reaction classification model always based on the transformer architecture. The hypergraph is constructed on the fly, and the nodes are filtered and further expanded based on a Bayesian-like probability. We critically assessed the end-to-end framework with several retrosynthesis examples from literature and academic exams. Overall, the frameworks have an excellent performance with few weaknesses related to the training data. The use of the introduced metrics opens up the possibility to optimize entire retrosynthetic frameworks by focusing on the performance of the single-step model only.},

  abstract = {The reactive force-field (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.},

We propose a GGA nonadditive kinetic energy functional which mimics the good behavior of nonlocal functionals retaining the computational complexity of typical semilocal functionals. The new functional reproduces Kohn-Sham DFT and benchmark CCSD(T) interaction energies of weakly interacting dimers in the S22-5 and S66 test sets with a mean absolute deviation well below 1 kcal/mol.},

  abstract = {The cost of calculating nuclear hessians, either analytically or by finite difference methods, during the course of quantum chemical analyses can be prohibitive for systems containing hundreds of atoms. In many applications, though, only a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and not the full hessian, are required. For instance, the lowest one or two eigenvalues of the full hessian are sufficient to characterize a stationary point as a minimum or a transition state (TS), respectively. We describe here a method that can eliminate the need for hessian calculations for both the characterization of stationary points as well as searches for saddle points. A finite differences implementation of the Davidson method that uses only first derivatives of the energy to calculate the lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hessian is discussed. This method can be implemented in conjunction with geometry optimization methods such as partitioned-rational function optimization (P-RFO) to characterize stationary points on the potential energy surface. With equal ease, it can be combined with interpolation methods that determine TS guess structures, such as the freezing string method, to generate approximate hessian matrices in lieu of full hessians as input to P-RFO for TS optimization. This approach is shown to achieve significant cost savings relative to exact hessian calculation when applied to both stationary point characterization as well as TS optimization. The basic reason is that the present approach scales one power of system size lower since the rate of convergence is approximately independent of the size of the system. Therefore, the finite-difference Davidson method is a viable alternative to full hessian calculation for stationary point characterization and TS search particularly when analytical hessians are not available or require substantial computational effort.},

  abstract = {Abstract Highly correlated configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions going beyond the simple singles and doubles (CISD) model space can provide very reliable potential energy surfaces, describe electronic excited states, and yield benchmark energies and molecular properties for use in calibrating more approximate methods. Unfortunately, such wavefunctions are also notoriously difficult to evaluate due to their extreme computational demands. The dimension of a full CI procedure, which represents the exact solution of the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for a fixed one-particle basis set, grows factorially with the number of electrons and basis functions. For very large configuration spaces, the number of CI coupling coefficients becomes prohibitively large to store on disk; these coefficients must be evaluated as needed in a so-called direct CI procedure. Work done by several groups since 1980 has focused on using Slater determinants rather than spin ( S \^ 2 ) eigenfunctions because coupling coefficients are easier to compute with the former. We review the fundamentals of the configuration interaction method and discuss various determinant-based CI algorithms. Additionally, we consider some applications of highly correlated CI methods.},

Many algorithmic approaches exist that perform explorations efficiently and in an automated fashion. These approaches differ in their application range, the level of completeness of the exploration, and the amount of heuristics and human intervention required. Here, we describe and compare the different approaches based on these criteria. Future directions leveraging the strengths of chemical heuristics, human interaction, and physical rigor are discussed.},

  abstract = {High-level quantum chemical computations have provided significant insight into the fundamental physical nature of non-covalent interactions. These studies have focused primarily on gas-phase computations of small van der Waals dimers; however, these interactions frequently take place in complex chemical environments, such as proteins, solutions, or solids. To better understand how the chemical environment affects non-covalent interactions, we have undertaken a quantum chemical study of {$\pi$}\textendash{$\pi$} interactions in an aqueous solution, as exemplified by T-shaped benzene dimers surrounded by 28 or 50 explicit water molecules. We report interaction energies (IEs) using second-order M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory, and we apply the intramolecular and functional-group partitioning extensions of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (ISAPT and F-SAPT, respectively) to analyze how the solvent molecules tune the {$\pi$}\textendash{$\pi$} interactions of the solute. For complexes containing neutral monomers, even 50 explicit waters (constituting a first and partial second solvation shell) change total SAPT IEs between the two solute molecules by only tenths of a kcal mol-1, while significant changes of up to 3~kcal mol-1 of the electrostatic component are seen for the cationic pyridinium\textendash benzene dimer. This difference between charged and neutral solutes is attributed to large non-additive three-body interactions within solvated ion-containing complexes. Overall, except for charged solutes, our quantum computations indicate that nearby solvent molecules cause very little ``tuning'' of the direct solute\textendash solute interactions. This indicates that differences in binding energies between the gas phase and solution phase are primarily indirect effects of the competition between solute\textendash solute and solute\textendash solvent interactions.},

  abstract = {Minimum energy structures and interaction energies are obtained for a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) interacting with a methane molecule. The PAHs include benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, tetracene, pyrene, and coronene. Interaction energies are calculated using the highest level of theory and basis set available, that is, complete-basis-set extrapolated MP2 plus a conventional or explicitly correlated CCSD(T) correction in moderately sized basis sets. The results show that the singly coordinated minimum configuration observed earlier for benzene\textbackslash textminusmethane is no longer the global minimum one for naphthalene and larger PAHs. Instead, triply coordinated geometries are lower in energy. The global minimum structures for methane interacting with extended systems like graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes are likely to be triply coordinated as well. A variety of novel dispersion-including DFT approaches are compared against the wave-function-based benchmark potential energy curves. The top performer, the B3LYP functional combined with the -D3 dispersion correction, is then employed to calculate interaction energies for methane interacting with hexabenzocoronene and circumcoronene in order to estimate the methane adsorption energy on graphite. The delicate balance between dispersion and exchange in PAH\textbackslash textminusmethane interactions is elucidated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory with a DFT description of monomers. The present study provides an important benchmark for the design and tuning of more approximate methods for an accurate description of hydrocarbon physisorption on carbon nanostructures.},

Metal-organic frameworks or biological macromolecules involve complex architectures and a large variety of elements. Yet, a general and broadly applicable theoretical method to describe the structures and interactions of molecules beyond the 1000-atom size regime semi-quantitatively is not self-evident. For this purpose, a generic force field named GFN-FF is presented, which is completely newly developed to enable fast structure optimizations and molecular-dynamics simulations for basically any chemical structure consisting of elements up to radon. The freely available computer program requires only starting coordinates and elemental composition as input from which, fully automatically, all potential-energy terms are constructed. GFN-FF outperforms other force fields in terms of generality and accuracy, approaching the performance of much more elaborate quantum-mechanical methods in many cases.},

Our model uses 75\% fewer parameters than previous studies, an improved reaction representation, and proper data splits to accurately estimate performance on unseen reactions. Using information from only the reactant and product, our model quickly predicts barrier heights with a testing MAE of 2.6 kcal mol\textendash 1 relative to the coupled-cluster data, making it more accurate than a good density functional theory calculation. Furthermore, our results show that future modeling efforts to estimate reaction properties would significantly benefit from fine-tuning calibration using a transfer learning technique.

  abstract = {Chemical compound space refers to the vast set of all possible chemical compounds, estimated to contain 1060 molecules. While intractable as a whole, modern machine learning (ML) is increasingly capable of accurately predicting molecular properties in important subsets. Here, we therefore engage in the ML-driven study of even larger reaction space. Central to chemistry as a science of transformations, this space contains all possible chemical reactions. As an important basis for `reactive' ML, we establish a first-principles database (Rad-6) containing closed and open-shell organic molecules, along with an associated database of chemical reaction energies (Rad-6-RE). We show that the special topology of reaction spaces, with central hub molecules involved in multiple reactions, requires a modification of existing compound space ML-concepts. Showcased by the application to methane combustion, we demonstrate that the learned reaction energies offer a non-empirical route to rationally extract reduced reaction networks for detailed microkinetic analyses.},

The mechanisms are incorporated into modules that are used to calculate the chemical sources and sinks of ozone and the precursors of particulates. Fifty years ago essential atmospheric chemical processes, such as the importance of the hydroxyl radical, were unknown and crude air quality models incorporated only a few parameterized reactions obtained by fitting observations. Over the years, chemical mechanisms for air quality modeling improved and became more detailed as more experimental data and more powerful computers became available. However it will not be possible to incorporate a detailed treatment of the chemistry for all known chemical constituents because there are thousands of organic compounds emitted into the atmosphere. Some simplified method of treating atmospheric organic chemistry is required to make air quality modeling computationally possible. The majority of the significant differences between air quality mechanisms are due to the differing methods of treating this organic chemistry. The purpose of this review is to present an overview of atmospheric chemistry that is incorporated into air quality mechanisms and to suggest areas in which more research is needed.},

We also propose a method to obtain such charges based on a mapping from approximate electronic wave functions. The method is illustrated by parameterizing two new charge models called AM1-CM1A and PM3-CM1P, based on experimental dipole moments and, respectively, on AM1 and PM3 semiempirical electronic wave functions. These charge models yield rms errors of 0.30 and 0.26 D, respectively, in the dipole moments of a set of 195 neutral molecules consisting of 103 molecules containing H, C, N and O, covering variations of multiple common organic functional groups, 68 fluorides, chlorides, bromides and iodides, 15 compounds containing H, C, Si or S, and 9 compounds containing C-S-O or C-N-O linkages. In addition, partial charges computed with this method agree extremely well with high-level ab initio calculations for both neutral compounds and ions. The CM1 charge models provide a more accurate point charge representation of the dipole moment than provided by most previously available partial charges, and they are far less expensive to compute.},

  abstract = {This review sets out to understand the reactivity of diradicals and how that may differ from monoradicals. In the first part of the review, we delineate the electronic structure of a diradical with its two degenerate or nearly degenerate molecular orbitals, occupied by two electrons. A classification of diradicals based on whether or not the two SOMOs can be located on different sites of the molecule is useful in determining the ground state spin. Important is a delocalized to localized orbital transformation that interchanges ``closed-shell'' to ``open-shell'' descriptions. The resulting duality is useful in understanding the dual reactivity of singlet diradicals. In the second part of the review, we examine, with a consistent level of theory, activation energies of prototypical radical reactions (dimerization, hydrogen abstraction, and addition to ethylene) for representative organic diradicals and diradicaloids in their two lowest spin states. Differences and similarities in reactivity of diradicals vs monoradicals, based on either a localized or delocalized view, whichever is suitable, are then discussed. The last part of this review begins with an extensive, comparative, and critical survey of available measures of diradical character and ends with an analysis of the consequences of diradical character for selected diradicaloids.},

To ensure easy of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran based quantum chemistry programs.

  abstract = {The collision-induced absorption (CIA) spectra of oxygen and dry air have been measured in the near-infrared and visible regions, covering the O2(B) band at 687\,nm and double transitions in the 630\,nm and 577\,nm regions. A custom-design 1\,m path length high-pressure cell was developed and configured to a Bruker 125HR Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A super-luminous Laser Driven Light Source (LDLS) was also used to improve the photon flux incident upon the spectrometer. A series of spectra of pure O2 and dry air were obtained at various high pressures up to 131~bars at room temperature. For the measurement of O2\textendash O2 CIA in the B band region, the monomer resonance absorption contribution has been subtracted from the observed spectra by simulating the O2(B) band absorption with a speed-dependent Voigt line shape profile with line mixing effects taken into account. The remaining absorption component was regarded as the CIA in the region. The integrated absorption coefficient was measured to be 3.2(6)~\texttimes ~10-6~cm-2/Amagat2 for the O2(B) band region, which is significantly lower than literature values. For the two double transition bands in the 630 and 577\,nm regions, the integrated CIA bands from the present work were measured to be 2.50(14) and 3.26(18)~\texttimes ~10-4~cm-2/Amagat2, respectively. The present measurements are significantly higher than prior measurements for the 630 nm band region, while they are slightly lower than prior measurements for the 577 nm band region. For dry air, the integrated CIA bands were measured to be 0.10(2) and 0.15(2)~\texttimes ~10-4~cm-2/Amagat2, respectively, for the 630 and 577\,nm regions, no appreciable contribution from O2\textendash N2 pairs was observed. The results are compiled in electronic supplements.},

  abstract = {Weakly bound non-valence anions are molecular systems where the excess electron stabilizes in a very diffuse orbital whose size, shape, and binding energy ({$\sim$}1-100 meV) are governed by the long-range electrostatic potential of the molecule. Its binding energy comes mainly from charge-dipole or charge- multipole interactions or dispersion forces. While highly correlated methods, like coupled cluster methods, are considered to be the state of the art for describing anionic systems, especially when the electron lies in a very diffuse orbital, we consider here the possibility to use DFT-based calculations. In such molecular anions, the outer electron experiences long-range exchange and correlation interactions. We show that DFT can describe longrange bound states provided that a correct asymptotic exchange and correlation potential is used, namely, that from a range-separated hybrid functional. This opens an alternative to the computationally demanding highly correlated method calculations. It is also suggested that the study of weakly bound anions could help in the construction of new DFT potentials to study systems where nonlocal effects are significant.},

  abstract = {Electron-transfers accompanied by a change in metal atom spin-state occur widely in chemistry and biology. An appropriate framework for interpreting such behavior is an electrochemical scheme of squares consisting of two one-electron electrode reactions and two spin-equilibrium steps. The presence of coupled electron-transfers and spin-exchanges is reflected in the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of such events. Oxidation\textendash reduction potentials and electron-transfer rate constants depend on the positions of the spin-state equilibria in the two oxidation states. Electrochemical activation parameters exhibit significant contributions from the large enthalpic and entropic differences that characterize spin-exchange reactions. The entropy of an electrochemical half-reaction, {$\Delta$}S\textdegree rc, coupled to a spin-exchange reflects the increases in vibrational and electronic entropy that accompany low- to high-spin conversion. Electrochemical enthalpies and entropies of activation, {$\Delta$}H\textbackslash ddag and {$\Delta$}S\textbackslash ddag, are influenced by the temperature dependence of the accompanying spin-state transitions and are useful in mechanism diagnosis. The present review describes examples from the literature and our own laboratory regarding Fe(III/II) (d5/d6) and Co(III/II) (d6/d7) couples that exhibit the above behavior.},

Their solution, however, sometimes fails to give a correct rotation matrix and gives a reflection instead when the data is severely corrupted. The theorem given in this correspondence is a strict solution of the problem, and it always gives the correct transformation parameters even when the data is corrupted.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.},

The chosen site is classified as a complementary NDSC site. Eight groups from seven countries participated in the campaign which focused on the measurements of slant columns of NO2, BrO, and OClO. This first campaign publication concentrates on measurements of the NO2 slant columns. Different analysis criteria were investigated during the campaign. These included the use of fitting parameters as chosen by each group to provide what they considered to be optimized retrievals. Additional sets of parameters, imposed for all the groups, were also used, including the wavelength interval, absorption cross sections, and species fitted. Each instrument's results were compared to the measurements of selected reference instruments, whose choice was based on a technique combining regression analysis and examination of the residuals with solar zenith angle. Considering the data obtained during the whole campaign for solar zenith angles between 75\textdegree{} and 95\textdegree, all instruments agreed within 5\% in the case of NO2 with imposed analysis parameters in the 425\textendash 450 nm region. Measurements agree less well when retrieving the NO2 slant columns in the 400\textendash 418 nm region or when using parameters optimized by each investigator for their instrument.},

  abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij \textrightarrow{} 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

These reactions, occurring sequentially and in parallel, give rise to intertwined and irreducible mechanisms describing the complex chemical transformations of organic and inorganic compounds in the atmosphere. The complexity of this system is that it requires combined experimental, theoretical, and modeling approaches to elucidate the characteristics of the individual reactions, and their mutual interaction. In this review, we describe recent results from quantum chemical and theoretical kinetic studies of relevance to atmospheric chemistry. The review first summarizes the most commonly used theoretical methodologies. It then examines the VOC oxidation initiation channels by OH, O3, NO3 and Cl, followed by the reactions of the alkyl, alkoxy, alkylperoxy and Criegee intermediates active in the subsequent oxidation steps. Specific systems such as the oxidation of aromatics and the current state of knowledge on OH-regeneration in VOC oxidation are also discussed, as well as some inorganic reactions.},

Current and future mechanism development efforts and research needs are discussed, including software-aided autogeneration and maintenance of kinetic models as a future-proof approach for atmospheric model development. There is an overarching need for the evaluation and extension of structure-activity relationships (SARs) that predict the properties and reactions of the many multifunctionalized compounds in the atmosphere that are at the core of detailed mechanisms, but for which no direct chemical data are available. Here, we discuss the experimental and theoretical data needed to support the development of mechanisms and SARs, the types of SARs relevant to atmospheric chemistry, the current status and limitations of SARs for various types of atmospheric reactions, the status of thermochemical estimates needed for mechanism development, and our outlook for the future.

  abstract = {Fuel microchannels for regenerative cooling are receiving increasing attention in advanced aviation technologies. Those microchannels allow heat integration between the endothermic cracking of the jet fuels and their subsequent combustion. In this work, a detailed elementary-step kinetic model is developed to gain insights into the cracking chemistry of a Jet A surrogate (n-dodecane, isooctane, n-propyl benzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), which allows for further optimization of those aviation technologies. A dedicated procedure is described for the automated generation of kinetic models for multi-component mixtures with the open-source Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software. The full kinetic model is validated against experimental measurements in multiple reactor geometries, under various experimental conditions, including both a surrogate mixture and a commercial Jet A. The experimental data include new experimental measurements for the pyrolysis of a Jet A surrogate in a tubular reactor with a detailed product analysis using comprehensive 2D GC. The good performance of the kinetic model for data from a broad range of experimental conditions demonstrates the advantage of a kinetic model with detailed chemistry against empirical kinetic models that are limited in their applicability range. Further analysis of the important chemistry in the kinetic model shows that it is essential to account for cross-reactions between the different surrogate components.},

  abstract = {Atomic partial charges appear in the Coulomb term of many force-field models and can be derived from electronic structure calculations with a myriad of atoms-inmolecules (AIM) methods. More advanced models have also been proposed, using the distributed nature of the electron cloud and atomic multipoles. In this work, an electrostatic force field is defined through a concise approximation of the electron density, for which the Coulomb interaction is trivially evaluated. This approximate ``pro-density'' is expanded in a minimal basis of atom-centered s-type Slater density functions, whose parameters are optimized by minimizing the Kullback- Leibler divergence of the pro-density from a reference electron density, e.g., obtained from an electronic structure calculation. The proposed method, Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), is a variant of the Hirshfeld AIM method, but it can also be used as a density-fitting technique. An iterative algorithm to refine the pro-density is easily implemented with a linear-scaling computational cost, enabling applications to supramolecular systems. The benefits of the MBIS method are demonstrated with systematic applications to molecular databases and extended models of condensed phases. A comparison to 14 other AIM methods shows its effectiveness when modeling electrostatic interactions. MBIS is also suitable for rescaling atomic polarizabilities in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler scheme for dispersion interactions.},

  abstract = {While short-range noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are proving to be of importance in many chemical and biological systems, these atypical bindings happen within the so-called van der Waals envelope and pose an enormous challenge for current computational methods. We introduce SNCIAA, a database of 723 benchmark interaction energies of short-range noncovalent interactions between neutral/charged amino acids originated from protein x-ray crystal structures at the ``gold standard'' coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples/complete basis set [CCSD(T)/CBS] level of theory with a mean absolute binding uncertainty less than 0.1 kcal/mol. Subsequently, a systematic assessment of commonly used computational methods, such as the second-order M\o ller-Plesset theory (MP2), density functional theory (DFT), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), composite electronic-structure methods, semiempirical approaches, and the physical-based potentials with machine learning (IPML) on SNCIAA is carried out. It is shown that the inclusion of dispersion corrections is essential even though these dimers are dominated by electrostatics, such as hydrogen bondings and salt bridges. Overall, MP2, {$\omega$}B97M-V, and B3LYP+D4 turned out to be the most reliable methods for the description of short-range NCIs even in strongly attractive/repulsive complexes. SAPT is also recommended in describing short-range NCIs only if the {$\delta$}MP2 correction has been included. The good performance of IPML for dimers at close-equilibrium and long-range conditions is not transferable to the short-range. We expect that SNCIAA will assist the development/improvement/validation of computational methods, such as DFT, force-fields, and ML models, in describing NCIs across entire potential energy surfaces (short-, intermediate-, and long-range NCIs) on the same footing.},

Several forms of sensory information can be used by the algorithm. That is, the measured data can be a combination of measured points on an object's surfaces and measured unit direction vectors located on the object. Simulations have been carried out on a Compaq 386/20 computer and the simulation results are analyzed.},

  abstract = {Ambient pressure in situ synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques have been correlated to illuminate atomic-level details of bond breaking and formation during the hydrolysis of a chemical warfare nerve agent simulant over a polyoxometalate catalyst. Specifically, a Cs8[Nb6O19] polyoxoniobate catalyst has been shown to react readily with dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The atomic-level transformations of all reactant moieties, the [Nb6O19]8- polyanion, its Cs+ counterions, and the DMMP substrate, were tracked under ambient conditions by a combination of X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Results reveal that the reaction mechanism follows general base (in contrast to specific base) hydrolysis. Together with computational results, the work demonstrates that the ultimate fate of DMMP hydrolysis at the Cs8[Nb6O19] catalyst is strong binding of the (methyl) methylphosphonic acid ((M)MPA) product to the polyanions, which ultimately inhibits catalytic turnover.},

We introduce a new Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variant that promotes balance between exploration and exploitation across the synthesis space. Together with a value network trained from reinforcement learning and a solvent-prediction neural network, our algorithm is comparable to the best MCTS variant (PUCT, similar to Google's Alpha Go) in finding valid synthesis pathways within a fixed searching time, and superior in identifying shorter routes with greener solvents under the same search conditions. In addition, with the same root compound visit count, our algorithm outperforms the PUCT MCTS by 16\% in terms of determining successful routes. Overall the success rate is improved by 19.7\% compared to the upper confidence bound applied to trees (UCT) MCTS method. Moreover, we improve 71.4\% of the routes proposed by the PUCT MCTS variant in pathway length and choices of green solvents. The approach generally enables including Green Chemistry considerations in computer aided synthesis planning with potential applications in process development for fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals.},

  abstract = {Calculation of molecular geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies are pre-requisites for thermochemistry calculations. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this paper demonstrates that quantum chemical predictions of the thermochemistry of many gas and solution phase chemical reactions appear to be very insensitive to the choice of basis sets. For a large test set of 80 diverse organic and transition-metal-containing reactions, variations in reaction free energy based on geometries and frequencies calculated using a variety of double and triple-zeta basis sets from the Pople, Jensen, Ahlrichs, and Dunning families are typically less than 4 kJ mol\textendash 1, especially when the quasiharmonic oscillator correction is applied to mitigate the effects of low-frequency modes. Our analysis indicates that for many organic molecules and their transition states, high-level revDSD-PBEP86-D4 and DLPNO-CCSD(T)/(aug-)cc-pVTZ single-point energies usually vary by less than 2 kJ mol\textendash 1 on density functional theory geometries optimized using basis sets ranging from 6-31+G(d) to aug-pcseg-2 and aug-cc-pVTZ. In cases where these single-point energies vary significantly, indicating sensitivity of molecular geometries to the choice of basis set, there is often substantial cancellation of errors when the reaction energy or barrier is calculated. The study concludes that the choice of basis set for molecular geometry and frequencies, particularly those considered in this study, is not critical for the accuracy of thermochemistry calculations in the gas or solution phase.},

  abstract = {Two papers by Brian Kobilka and colleagues describe the X-ray crystal structure of the human {$\beta$}2 adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}2AR) bound to various agonists. {$\beta$}2AR is a member of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family of membrane-spanning receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate internal signalling pathways. With a ubiquitous role in human physiology, GPCRs are prime targets for drug discovery. A third paper by Christopher Tate and his team describes crystal structures of a similar GPCR, the turkey {$\beta$}1-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}1AR), bound to full and partial agonists. Together, these new structures reveal the subtle structural changes that accompany agonist binding, showing how binding events inside and outside the cell membrane stabilize the receptor's active state. Agonist binding to {$\beta$}1AR is shown to induce a contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist-bound receptor, and molecular-dynamics simulations of the {$\beta$}2AR agonist complex suggest that the agonist-bound active state spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like state in the absence of a G protein. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of the {$\beta$}1 adrenergic receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, bound to four small molecules that either act as full agonists or partial agonists is solved. The structures show that agonist binding induces a contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist-bound receptor. This work reveals the pharmacological differences between different ligand classes, which should facilitate the structure-based design of new drugs with predictable efficacies. {$\beta$}-adrenergic receptors ({$\beta$}ARs) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular G proteins upon binding catecholamine agonist ligands such as adrenaline and noradrenaline1,2. Synthetic ligands have been developed that either activate or inhibit {$\beta$}ARs for the treatment of asthma, hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. These ligands are classified as either full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, depending on whether the cellular response is similar to that of the native ligand, reduced or inhibited, respectively. However, the structural basis for these different ligand efficacies is unknown. Here we present four crystal structures of the thermostabilized turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) {$\beta$}1-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}1AR-m23) bound to the full agonists carmoterol and isoprenaline and the partial agonists salbutamol and dobutamine. In each case, agonist binding induces a 1 \AA{} contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist bound receptor. Full agonists can form hydrogen bonds with two conserved serine residues in transmembrane helix 5 (Ser5.42 and Ser5.46), but partial agonists only interact with Ser5.42 (superscripts refer to Ballesteros\textendash Weinstein numbering3). The structures provide an understanding of the pharmacological differences between different ligand classes, illuminating how GPCRs function and providing a solid foundation for the structure-based design of novel ligands with predictable efficacies.},

We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF\textbackslash char21vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF\textbackslash char21vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF\textbackslash char21vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Applications of the approximation and its Bayesian ensemble error estimate to two intricate surface science problems support this.},

  abstract = {Machine learning interatomic potentials (IPs) can provide accuracy close to that of first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), at a fraction of the computational cost. This greatly extends the scope of accurate molecular simulations, providing opportunities for quantitative design of materials and devices on scales hitherto unreachable by DFT methods. However, machine learning IPs have a basic limitation in that they lack a physical model for the phenomena being predicted and therefore have unknown accuracy when extrapolating outside their training set. In this paper, we propose a class of Dropout Uncertainty Neural Network (DUNN) potentials that provide rigorous uncertainty estimates that can be understood from both Bayesian and frequentist statistics perspectives. As an example, we develop a DUNN potential for carbon and show how it can be used to predict uncertainty for static and dynamical properties, including stress and phonon dispersion in graphene. We demonstrate two approaches to propagate uncertainty in the potential energy and atomic forces to predicted properties. In addition, we show that DUNN uncertainty estimates can be used to detect configurations outside the training set, and in some cases, can serve as a predictor for the accuracy of a calculation.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods have great potential to transform chemical discovery by accelerating the exploration of chemical space and drawing scientific insights from data. However, modern chemical reaction ML models, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), must be trained on a large amount of labelled data in order to avoid overfitting the data and thus possessing low accuracy and transferability. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage unlabelled data to learn accurate ML models for small labelled chemical reaction data. We focus on an old and prominent problem\textemdash classifying reactions into distinct families\textemdash and build a GNN model for this task. We first pretrain the model on unlabelled reaction data using unsupervised contrastive learning and then fine-tune it on a small number of labelled reactions. The contrastive pretraining learns by making the representations of two augmented versions of a reaction similar to each other but distinct from other reactions. We propose chemically consistent reaction augmentation methods that protect the reaction center and find they are the key for the model to extract relevant information from unlabelled data to aid the reaction classification task. The transfer learned model outperforms a supervised model trained from scratch by a large margin. Further, it consistently performs better than models based on traditional rule-driven reaction fingerprints, which have long been the default choice for small datasets, as well as those based on reaction fingerprints derived from masked language modelling. In addition to reaction classification, the effectiveness of the strategy is tested on regression datasets; the learned GNN-based reaction fingerprints can also be used to navigate the chemical reaction space, which we demonstrate by querying for similar reactions. The strategy can be readily applied to other predictive reaction problems to uncover the power of unlabelled data for learning better models with a limited supply of labels.},

The 298 K heats of formation for ortho-, meta-, and para-benzyne derived in this manner are 106.6 {$\pm$} 3.0, 122.0 {$\pm$} 3.1, and 137.3 {$\pm$} 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The values for meta- and para-benzyne are higher than those reported previously (Wenthold, P. G.; Paulino, J. A.; Squires, R. R., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991,113, 7414) but are in excellent agreement with recently reported MCSCF and Cl calculations. Several control experiments are described which demonstrate that the earlier results for meta- and para-benzyne suffered from an acid-catalyzed isomerization of the reactant chlorophenyl anions in the flowing afterglow prior to CID threshold analysis. It is shown that CID threshold measurements with chlorophenyl-c/* anions are necessary in order to obtain the correct dissociation energies for the isomerically pure species. The gas-phase acidities of the meta and para positions of chlorobenzene were determined at 298 K using the silane cleavage method to be 391.1 {$\pm$} 2.0 and 393.9 {$\pm$} 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The heats of formation for the benzynes determined in this study are used to derive the gas-phase acidity of the 2-position of mefo-benzyne (365 {$\pm$} 3 kcal/mol) and the ortho, meta, and para C-H bond strengths in phenyl radical (79.9 {$\pm$}3.1,95.3 {$\pm$} 3.2, and 110.6 {$\pm$} 3.4 kcal/mol, respectively). The cycloaromatization of c/\'i-3-hexene-1,5-diyne to para-benzyne (the Bergman cyclization) is calculated to be endothermic by 13 kcal/mol.},

  abstract = {The isomeric m- and p-benzyne anions have been generated in the gas phase in a flowing afterglow-triple quadrupole instrument from the reactions of molecular fluorine (F2) with m- and p-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl anions. The mechanism of the F2 reaction involves electron transfer from the (trimethylsilyl)phenyl anion to F2, followed by nucleophilic attack on the resulting (trimethylsilyl)phenyl radical by the nascent F- formed within the intermediate ion/molecule complex. The structures of o-, m-, and p-benzyne anion are unambiguously identified by a classical derivatization scheme wherein the ions are first converted to the corresponding o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzoates by stepwise addition of CO2 and NO2. These derivatives are then identified by forming proton-bound dimers of each ion with CHF2CO2H, and comparing the O2NC6H4CO2-/CHF2CO2- yield ratios obtained by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with those obtained from analogous experiments with the authentic nitrobenzoate ions. Estimates of the electron affinities of m- and p-benzyne have been determined by the kinetic method. Adducts of SO2 with phenide ion and each of the isomeric benzyne anions are formed that produce measurable yields of SO2\textbullet - and the corresponding C6Hn- ion upon CID. A calibration relation is derived between the CID yield ratios obtained for the C6H5SO2- and o-C6H4SO2\textbullet - adducts and the known electron affinities of phenyl radical (25.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 kcal/mol) and o-benzyne (12.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 kcal/mol). The measured CID ratios for the m- and p-benzyne SO2 adducts are then combined with this relation to obtain EA(m-benzyne) = 19.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 kcal/mol and EA(p-benzyne) = 28.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 kcal/mol. These data are used to derive the following gas-phase acidities for the different ring positions of phenyl radical and the corresponding C-H bond strengths for the phenide ion ({$\Delta$}Hacid(C6H5), DH298[C6H4--H], kcal/mol):\, ortho 378.2 {$\pm$} 3.1, 93.7 {$\pm$} 3.1; meta 386.9 {$\pm$} 3.1, 102.4 {$\pm$} 3.1; para 393.5 {$\pm$} 2.9, 109.0 {$\pm$} 2.9.},

This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S = 1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10 The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Current methods for the prediction of biodegradation products and pathways of organic environmental pollutants either do not take into account domain knowledge or do not provide probability estimates. In this article, we propose a hybrid knowledge- and machine learning-based approach to overcome these limitations in the context of the University of Minnesota Pathway Prediction System (UM-PPS). The proposed solution performs relative reasoning in a machine learning framework, and obtains one probability estimate for each biotransformation rule of the system. As the application of a rule then depends on a threshold for the probability estimate, the trade-off between recall (sensitivity) and precision (selectivity) can be addressed and leveraged in practice.Results: Results from leave-one-out cross-validation show that a recall and precision of {$\sim$}0.8 can be achieved for a subset of 13 transformation rules. Therefore, it is possible to optimize precision without compromising recall. We are currently integrating the results into an experimental version of the UM-PPS server.Availability: The program is freely available on the web at http://wwwkramer.in.tum.de/research/applications/biodegradation/data.Contact: ~kramer@in.tum.de},

  abstract = {We report a new general method for trapping short-lived radicals, based on a homolytic substitution reaction SH2{${'}$}. This departure from conventional radical trapping by addition or radical\textendash radical cross-coupling results in high sensitivity, detailed structural information, and general applicability of the new approach. The radical traps in this method are terminal alkenes possessing a nitroxide leaving group (e.g., allyl-TEMPO derivatives). The trapping process thus yields stable products which can be stored and subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) supported by well-established techniques such as isotope exchange, tandem MS, and high-performance liquid chromatography-MS. The new method was applied to a range of model radical reactions in both liquid and gas phases including a photoredox-catalyzed thiol\textendash ene reaction and alkene ozonolysis. An unprecedented range of radical intermediates was observed in complex reaction mixtures, offering new mechanistic insights. Gas-phase radicals can be detected at concentrations relevant to atmospheric chemistry.},

The workshops have focused on developing lists of Core Principles or Foundational Concepts in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a list of foundational skills, and foundational concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics that all Biochemistry or Molecular Biology majors must understand to complete their major coursework. The allied fields working group created a survey to validate foundational concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics identified from participant feedback at various workshops. One-hundred twenty participants responded to the survey and 68\% of the respondents answered yes to the question: ``We have identified the following as the core concepts and underlying theories from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics that Biochemistry majors or Molecular Biology majors need to understand after they complete their major courses: 1) mechanical concepts from Physics, 2) energy and thermodynamic concepts from Physics, 3) critical concepts of structure from chemistry, 4) critical concepts of reactions from Chemistry, and 5) essential Mathematics. In your opinion, is the above list complete?'' Respondents also delineated subcategories they felt should be included in these broad categories. From the results of the survey and this analysis the allied fields working group constructed a consensus list of allied fields concepts, which will help inform Biochemistry and Molecular Biology educators when considering the ASBMB recommended curriculum for Biochemistry or Molecular Biology majors and in the development of appropriate assessment tools to gauge student understanding of how these concepts relate to biochemistry and molecular biology. \textcopyright{} 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 41(5):302\textendash 308, 2013},

With this issue as the focal point, we present a new machine learning approach called ``BpopNN'' for obtaining efficient approximations to DFT PESs. Conceptually, the methodology is based on approaching the true DFT energy as a function of electron populations on atoms; in practice, this is realized with available density functionals and constrained DFT (CDFT). The new approach creates approximations to this function with neural networks. These approximations thereby incorporate electronic information naturally into a ML approach, and optimizing the model energy with respect to populations allows the electronic terms to self-consistently adapt to the environment, as in DFT. We confirm the effectiveness of this approach with a variety of calculations on LinHn clusters.},

The exceptional dual bonding features, (i) the axial hydroxide readily reacts with carboxylic acid or alcohol and (ii) the Lewis acid Al center forms an adduct with a Lewis base such as pyridine or imidazole, make the AlPor a unique building block for the construction of `axial-bonding' type multicomponent donor\textendash acceptor systems for a variety of applications. Additionally, due to the rich redox chemistry and optical properties, the AlPor can act as either a photosensitizing electron acceptor or electron donor in donor\textendash acceptor systems. Unlike the zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnPor), the AlPor based donor\textendash acceptor provides an axial topology to investigate the sequential photoinduced energy transfer (EnT) and/or electron transfer (ET) processes in perpendicular to the porphyrin ring. This review surveys AlPor based multicomponent donor\textendash acceptor systems designed to mimic the various components of natural photosynthesis to develop an artificial photosynthetic system for tapping solar energy. Additionally, the review examines the photocatalytic behavior of AlPor towards solar fuel production. Finally, we will discuss the similarities and differences between the `axial-bonding' type AlPor and ZnPor systems.},

In this work, a neural network-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized. Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory experiments could accomplish.},

  abstract = {Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool to study the reaction mechanism of complex chemical systems. Central to the method is the potential energy surface (PES) that can describe the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The development of both accurate and efficient PES has attracted significant effort in the past 2 decades. A recently developed deep potential (DP) model has the promise to bring ab initio accuracy to large-scale reactive MD simulations. However, for complex chemical reaction processes like pyrolysis, it remains challenging to generate reliable DP models with an optimal training data set. In this work, a data set construction scheme for such a purpose was established. The employment of a concurrent learning algorithm allows us to maximize the exploration of the chemical space while minimizing the redundancy of the data set. This greatly reduces the cost of computational resources required for ab initio calculations. Based on this method, we constructed a data set for the pyrolysis of n-dodecane, which contains 35\,496 structures. The reactive MD simulation with the DP model trained based on this data set revealed the pyrolysis mechanism of n-dodecane in detail, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, this data set shows excellent transferability to different long-chain alkanes. These results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method for constructing training data sets for similar systems.},

Matrix elements for SA-SF-CIS are then modified in a manner similar to collinear spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT), to include a DFT exchange-correlation correction. The performance of this method, which we call SA-SF-DFT, is evaluated numerically and we find that it systematically improves the energies of electronic states that exhibit significant spin contamination within the conventional SF-TDDFT approach. The new method cures the state assignment problem that plagues geometry optimizations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using traditional SF-TDDFT, without sacrificing computational efficiency, and furthermore provides correct topology at conical intersections, including those that involve the ground state, unlike conventional TDDFT. As such, SA-SF-DFT appears to be a promising method for generating excited-state potential energy surfaces at DFT cost.}

Here, we implemented several spectral fitting methods to retrieve tropospheric NO2, SO2, and HCHO from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI), with radiative simulations providing necessary information on the interactions of scattered solar light within the atmosphere. We analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal trends of satellite-observed air pollutants over eastern China during 2005\textendash 2017, especially in heavily polluted regions. We found significant decreasing trends in NO2 and SO2 since 2011 over most regions, despite varying temporal features and turning points. In contrast, an overall increasing trend was identified for tropospheric HCHO over these regions in recent years. Furthermore, generalized additive models were implemented to understand the driving forces of air quality trends in China and assess the effectiveness of emission controls. Our results indicated that although meteorological parameters, such as wind, water vapor, solar radiation and temperature, mainly dominated the day-to-day and seasonal fluctuations in air pollutants, anthropogenic emissions played a unique role in the long-term variation in the ambient concentrations of NO2, SO2, and HCHO in the past 13 years. Generally, recent declines in NO2 and SO2 could be attributed to emission reductions due to effective air quality policies, and the opposite trends in HCHO may urge the need to control anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.},

Under hydrostatic compression, the P\textendash V curve and the bulk modulus (B0) obtained using the VFRS equation of state show that the compressibility of the three crystals is nitroglycerine (NG) {$>$} erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) {$>$} 2,3-bis-hydroxymethyl-2,3-dinitro-1,4-butanediol tetranitrate (NEST-1). The a- and c-axis of ETN are easy to compress under the action of hydrostatic pressure, but the b-axis is not easy to compress. The b-axis of NEST-1 is the most compressible, while the a- and c-axis can be compressed slightly when the initial pressure increases and then remains unchanged afterward. The a-, b-, and c-axes of NG all have similar compressibilities. By analyzing the change trend of the main bond lengths of the crystals, it can be seen that the most stable of the three crystals is the N\textendash O bond and the largest change is in the O\textendash NO2 bond. The stability of the C\textendash O bond shows that the NO3 produced by nitrates is not from the C\textendash O bond fracture. Under uniaxial compression, the stress tensor component, the average principal stress, and the hydrostatic pressure have similar trends and amplitudes, indicating that the anisotropy behaviors of the three crystals ETN, NEST-1, and NG are weak. There is no significant correlation between maximum shear stress and sensitivity. The maximum shear stresses {$\tau$}xyand {$\tau$}yz of the ETN in the [010] direction are 1.5 GPa higher than {$\tau$}xz. However, the maximum shear stress of NG shows irregularity in different compression directions, indicating that there is no obvious correlation between the maximum shear stress and sensitivity.},

Most molecules adsorb weakly on SWNTs and can be either charge donors or acceptors to the nanotubes. We find that the gas adsorption on the bundle interstitial and groove sites is stronger than that on individual nanotubes. The electronic properties of SWNTs are sensitive to the adsorption of certain gases such as NO2 and O2. Charge transfer and gas-induced charge fluctuation might significantly affect the transport properties of SWNTs. Our theoretical results are consistent with recent experiments.},

  abstract = {Automated reaction prediction has the potential to elucidate complex reaction networks for applications ranging from combustion to materials degradation, but computational cost and inconsistent reaction coverage are still obstacles to exploring deep reaction networks. Here we show that cost can be reduced and reaction coverage can be increased simultaneously by relatively straightforward modifications of the reaction enumeration, geometry initialization and transition state convergence algorithms that are common to many prediction methodologies. These components are implemented in the context of yet another reaction program (YARP), our reaction prediction package with which we report reaction discovery benchmarks for organic single-step reactions, thermal degradation of a {$\gamma$}-ketohydroperoxide, and competing ring-closures in a large organic molecule. Compared with recent benchmarks, YARP (re)discovers both established and unreported reaction pathways and products while simultaneously reducing the cost of reaction characterization by nearly 100-fold and increasing convergence of transition states. This combination of ultra-low cost and high reaction coverage creates opportunities to explore the reactivity of larger systems and more complex reaction networks for applications such as chemical degradation, where computational cost is a bottleneck.},

Absorption spectra of mixtures of CO\textendash N2O and mixtures of C2H2\textendash CH4\textendash N2O, both diluted in N2, were detected in the mid-IR range by exploiting quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) and using two quantum cascade lasers as light sources. Single-gas reference spectra of each target molecule were acquired and used as PLSR-based algorithm training data set. The concentration range explored in the analysis varies from a few parts-per-million (ppm) to thousands of ppm. Within this concentration range, the influence of the gas matrix on nonradiative relaxation processes can be neglected. Exploiting the ability of PLSR to deal with correlated data, these spectra were used to generate new simulated spectra, i.e., linear combinations of the reference ones. A Gaussian noise distribution was added to the created data set, simulating the real QEPAS signal fluctuations around the peak value. Compared with standard multilinear regression, PLSR predicted gas concentrations with a calibration error up to 5 times better, even with absorption features with spectral overlap greater than 97\%.},

  abstract = {Atomic and molecular properties could be evaluated from the fundamental Schrodinger's equation and therefore represent different modalities of the same quantum phenomena. Here, we present AIMNet, a modular and chemically inspired deep neural network potential. We used AIMNet with multitarget training to learn multiple modalities of the state of the atom in a molecular system. The resulting model shows on several benchmark datasets state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to the results of orders of magnitude more expensive DFT methods. It can simultaneously predict several atomic and molecular properties without an increase in the computational cost. With AIMNet, we show a new dimension of transferability: the ability to learn new targets using multimodal information from previous training. The model can learn implicit solvation energy (SMD method) using only a fraction of the original training data and an archive median absolute deviation error of 1.1 kcal/mol compared to experimental solvation free energies in the MNSol database.},
